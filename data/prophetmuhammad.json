                "How It All Began": "Nearly four thousand years ago, in the Sumerian town of Ur in the valley of the river Euphrates, lived a young man named Abraham. The people of Ur  had  once  worshipped  Allah  but  as  time  passed  they  forgot  the  true religion  and  started  praying  to  idols,  statues  made  of  wood  or  clay  and sometimes even of precious stones. Even as a small child Abraham could not  understand  how  his  people,  and  especially  his  father,  could  make these  images  with  their  own  hands,  call  them  gods,  and  then  worship them. He had always refused to join his people when they paid respect to these  statues.  Instead  he  would  leave  the  town  and  sit  alone,  thinking about the heavens and the world about him. He was sure his people were doing wrong and so alone he searched for the right way.  One clear night as  he  sat  staring  at  the  sky  he  saw  a  beautiful  shining  star,  so  beautiful that he cried out: „This must be Allah!' He looked at it in awe for some time,  until  suddenly  it  began  to  fade  and  then  it  disappeared.  He  turned away in disappointment saying: I love not things that set. (Qur'an 6.77) On another night Abraham  was again looking at the sky and he saw the rising moon, so big and bright that he felt he could almost touch it. He thought  to  himself:  This  is  my  Lord.  (Qur'an  6.78)  But  it  was  not  long before the moon set as well. Then he said, Unless my  Lord guide me, I surely  shall  become  one  of  the  folk  who  are  astray.  (Qur'an  6.78) Abraham  then  saw  the  beauty  and  splendor  of  the  sunrise  and  decided that the sun must be the biggest and most powerful thing in the universe. But for the third time he was wrong, for the sun set at the end of the day. It was then that he realized that Allah is the Most Powerful, the Creator of the stars, the moon, the sun, the earth and of all living things. Suddenly he felt himself totally at peace, because he knew that he had found the Truth. When he said unto his father and his folk: What do you worship? They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted to them. He said: Do they hear you when you cry? Or do they benefit or harm you? They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting in this manner. He said: See now that which you worship, You and your forefathers! Lo! they are (all) an enemy to me, except  the Lord of the Worlds. Who created me, and He guides me, And Who feeds me  and waters me. And when I sicken, then He heals me. And Who causes me to die, then gives me lift (again) And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of judgement. (Qur'an 26.70-82)     One  day,  while  all  the  townspeople  were  out,  Abraham  angrily smashed all the idols with his right hand except for one which was very large. When the people returned they were furious. They remembered the things Abraham had said about the idols. They had him brought forth before everyone and demanded, 'Is it you who did this to our gods, 0 Abraham?' Abraham replied, But this their chief did it. Ask  them,  if  they  are  able  to  speak.'  The  people  exclaimed,  'You  know they  do  not  speak.'  'Do  you  worship  what  you  yourselves  have  carved when  Allah  created  you  and  what  you  make?'  Abraham  continued,  'Do you worship instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you?' (Qur'an 37.95-6)(Qur'an 21.66) Finally, Abraham warned them, Serve Allah, and keep your duty unto Him;  that  is  better  for  you  if  you  did  but  know.  You  serve  instead  of Allah  only  idols,  and  you  only  invent  a  lie.  Lo!  those  whom  you  serve instead of Allah own no provision for you. So seek your provision from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks  unto Him, (for) unto Him you will be brought back.(Qur'an 29. 16-17) The people of Ur decided to give Abraham the worst punishment they could find: he was to be burnt to death. On the chosen day all the people gathered  in  the  centre  of  the  city  and  even  the  King  of  Ur  was  there. Abraham was then placed inside a special building filled with wood. The wood was lit. Soon the fire became so strong that the people were pushed back  by  the  flames.  But  Allah  said:    “O  fire,  be  coolness  and  peace  for Abraham”. (Qur'an 21.69) The people waited until the fire had completely died down, and it was then  that  they  saw  Abraham  still  sitting  there  as  though  nothing  had happened!  At  that  moment  they  were  utterly  confused.  They  were  not, however, moved by the miracle that had just happened before their very eyes. Still  Abraham  tried  to  persuade  his  own  dear  father,  who  was  named Azar, not to worship powerless, un-seeing, un-hearing statues. Abraham explained  that  special  knowledge  had  come  to  him  and  implored  his father, 'So follow me and I will lead you on the right path. 0 my father! Don't serve the Devil.' But Azar would not listen. He threatened his son with stoning if he continued to reject the gods of Ur. He ordered Abraham to  leave  the  city  with  these  words:  'Depart  from  me  a  long  while.' Abraham said, 'Peace be upon you! I shall ask my Lord's forgiveness for you. Surely He was ever gracious to me.‟ (Qur'an 19.43-7)    Imagine how terrible it must have been for him to leave his home, his family  and  all  that  he  knew,  and  set  out  across  the  wilderness  into  the unknown.  But  at  the  same  time,  how  could  he  have  remained  among people  who  did  not  believe  in  Allah  and  who  worshipped  statues? Abraham  always  had  a sense  that Allah  cared  for  him  and  he  felt  Allah near him as he traveled. At last, after a long hard journey, he arrived at a place by the Mediterranean Sea, not far from Egypt. There he married a noble woman by the name of Sarah  and settled in the land of Palestine. Many years passed but Abraham and his wife were not blessed with any children.  In  the  hope  that  there  would  be  a  child,  and  in  keeping  with tradition,  Sarah  suggested  that  Abraham  should  marry  Hagar,  her Egyptian  handmaid.  Soon  after  this  took  place,  Hagar  had  a  little  boy named  Ishmael.  Some  time  later  Allah  promised  Abraham  another  son, but this time the mother of the child would be his first wife, Sarah. This second son would be called Isaac. Allah also told Abraham that from his two  sons-Ishmael  and  Isaac-two  nations  and  three  religions  would  be founded and because of this he must take Hagar and Ishmael away from Palestine  to  a  new  land.  These  events  were  an  important  part  of  Allah's plan,  for  the  descendants  of  Ishmael  would  form  a  nation  from  which would come a great Prophet, who would guide the people in the way of Allah. This was to be Muhammad (pbuh), the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). From  the  descendants  of  Sarah's  child,  Isaac,  would  come  Moses  and Jesus. So  it  was  that  Abraham,  Hagar,  and  Ishmael  left  Palestine.  They traveled for many days until finally they reached the arid valley of Bacca later to be called Mecca), which was on one of the great caravan routes. There  was  no  water  in  the  valley  and  although  Hagar  and  Ishmael  only had a small supply of water left, Abraham left them there knowing Allah would take care of them. Soon all the water was gone. The child began to grow weak from thirst. There were two hills nearby, one called Safa and the other Marwah. Hagar went up one hill and looked into the distance to see if she could find any water, but found none. So she went to the other hill and did the same. She did this seven times. Then sadly she returned to her  son,  and  to  her  great  surprise  and  joy  she  found  a  spring  of  water bubbling  out  of  the  earth  near  him.  This  spring,  near  which  the  mother and child settled, was later called Zamzam. The area around it became a place of rest for the caravans travelling across the desert and in time grew into the famous trading city of Mecca. From time to time Abraham traveled from Palestine to visit his family and he saw Ishmael grow into a strong young man. It was during one of these  visits  that  Allah  commanded  them  to  rebuild  the  Ka'bah-the  very first  place  where  people  had  worshipped  Allah.  They  were  told  exactly   where  and  how  to  build  it.  It  was  to  be  erected  by  the  well  of  Zamzam and built in the shape of a cube. In its eastern corner was to be placed a black  stone  that  had  fallen  to  earth  from  heaven.  An  angel  brought  the stone to them from the nearby hill of Abu Qubays. Abraham and Ishmael worked hard to rebuild the Ka'bah and as they did so they prayed to Allah to send a Prophet from among their descendants. And when Abraham and Ishmael  were  raising  the  foundations  of  the  House,  (Abraham  prayed): 'Our Lord! Receive this from us; Thou, only Thou, art the All-hearing, the All-knowing; Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee  and of our seed  a  nation  submissive  unto  Thee,  and  show  us  our  ways  of  worship, and turn toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful. Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who shall  recite  unto  them  Thy  revelations,  and  shall  instruct  them  in  the Scripture  and  in  wisdom  and  shall  make  them  grow.  Lo!  Thou,  only Thou,  art  the  Mighty,  Wise.    (Qur'an  2.127-9)  When  the  Ka'bah  was completed, Allah commanded Abraham to call mankind to pilgrimage to His  Holy  House.  Abraham  wondered  how  anyone  could  hear  his  call. Allah said, 'You call and I will bring them.' This was how the pilgrimage to  the  Ka'bah  in  Mecca  was  established  and  when  Muslims  make  the pilgrimage today they continue to answer the age-old call of Abraham.   The Children of Ishmael Over  the  years  Ishmael's  children  themselves  had  children.  His descendants  increased  and  formed  tribes  which  spread  out  all  over Arabia. One of these tribes was called Quraysh. Its people never  moved away from Mecca and always lived near the Ka'bah. One of the duties of the leader of Quraysh was to look after those who came on pilgrimage to the Ka'bah. The, pilgrims would come from all over Arabia and it was a great honor to provide them with food and water. As  time  passed,  however,  the  Arabs  stopped  worshipping  Allah directly  and  started  bringing  idols  back  with  them  from  the  different countries they visited. These idols were placed at the Ka'bah, which was no longer regarded as the Sanctuary of Allah, as Abraham had intended it. It was, however, still respected by the Arabs. Around this time the well of Zamzam disappeared beneath the sand. Also at this time, Qusayy, one of the leaders of Quraysh, became ruler over Mecca. He held the keys of the temple  and  had  the  right  to  give  water  to  the  pilgrims,  to  feed  them,  to take charge of meetings, and to hand out war banners before battle. It was also in his house that Quraysh settled their affairs. After Qusayy's death, his  son  'Abdu  Manaf,  who  had  become  famous  during  his  father's lifetime,  took  over  the  leadership  of  Quraysh.  After  him  came  his  son Hashim. It is said that Hashim was the first to begin the two great caravan journeys of Quraysh, one in the summer to Syria and the north, and one in the  winter  to  Yemen  and  the  south.  As  a  result,  Mecca  grew  rich  and became a large and important centre of trade. One  summer  Hashim  went  north  to  buy  goods  to  sell  in  Yemen.  On his way he stopped in Yathrib to trade in the market and there he saw a beautiful  woman.  She  was  Salma',  the  daughter  of  'Amr  ibn  Zeid,  who was from a much respected family. Hashim proposed marriage to her and was accepted because he was an honorable and distinguished man. In  time,  Salma'  gave  birth  to  a  beautiful  son  and  as  some  of  his  hair was white they called him Shaybah, which in Arabic means grey-haired'. Mother  and  son  stayed  in  the  cooler,  healthier  climate  of  Yathrib, while  Hashim  returned  to  Mecca,  but  he  would  visit  them  each  time  he took  his  caravan  to  the  north.  During  one  of  these  journeys,  however, Hashim became ill and died. Shaybah, a handsome, intelligent boy, grew up  in  his  uncle's  house  in  Yathrib.  He  was  proud  of  being  the  son  of Hashim  ibn  'Abdi  Manaf,  the  head  of  Quraysh,  guardian  of  the  Ka'bah and protector of the pilgrims,  even though he had not known his father, who had died while Shaybah was very young."

During  one  of  these  journeys,  however, Hashim became ill and died. Shaybah, a handsome, intelligent boy, grew up  in  his  uncle's  house  in  Yathrib.  He  was  proud  of  being  the  son  of Hashim  ibn  'Abdi  Manaf,  the  head  of  Quraysh,  guardian  of  the  Ka'bah and protector of the pilgrims,  even though he had not known his father, who had died while Shaybah was very young.      At  Hashim's  death  his  brother  al-Muttalib  took  over  his  duties  and responsibilities. He traveled to Yathrib to see his nephew, Shaybah, and decided that as the boy would one day inherit his father's place, the time had  come  for  him  to  live  in  Mecca.  It  was  hard  for  Salma',  Shaybah's mother, to let her son go with his uncle  but she finally realized that it was for the best. Al-Muttalib returned to Mecca, entering the city at noon on his camel with Shaybah behind him. When the people of Mecca saw the boy they thought he was a slave and, pointing at him, called out „Abd al- Muttalib', 'Abd' being the Arabic for 'slave'. Al-Muttalib  told  them  that  Shaybah  was  not  a  slave  but  his  nephew who  had  come  to  live  with  them.  From  that  day  on,  however,  Shaybah was  always  affectionately  called  Abd  al-Muttalib.  On  the  death  of  al- Muttalib,  who  died  in  Yemen  where  he  had  gone  to  trade,  'Abd  al- Muttalib  took  his  place.  He  became  the  most  respected  member  of  his family,  loved  and  admired  by  all.  He  was,  however,  unlike  those  Arabs who had given up the teachings of Abraham.   The Promise At Zamzam The well of Zamzam, which disappeared when the Arabs placed idols at the  Ka'bah,  remained  buried  under  the  sand.  Thus,  for  many  years  the people of Quraysh had to fetch their water from far away. One day 'Abd al-Muttalib  was  very  tired  from  doing  this  and  fell  asleep  next  to  the Ka‟bah. He had a dream in which he was told to dig up Zamzam. When he woke up he was puzzled because he did not know what Zamzam was, the well having disappeared many years before he was born. The next day he had the same dream, but this time he was told where to find the well. 'Abd al-Muttalib had one son at that time, and together they began to dig.  The  work  was  so  difficult  that  „Abd  al-Muttalib  made  an  oath  to Allah that if one day he were to have ten sons to help him and stand by him,  in  return  he  would  sacrifice  one  of  them  in  Allah's  honor.  After working for three days they finally found the well of Zamzam. Pilgrims have been drinking from it ever since. The years passed by and 'Abd al- Muttalib did have ten sons. They grew into fine, strong men and the time came  for  him  to  keep  his  promise  to  Allah.  He  told  his  sons  about  the promise  and  they  agreed  that  he  had  to  sacrifice  one  of  them  To  see which one it would be, they decided to draw lots, which was the custom of Quraysh when deciding important matters. 'Abd al-Muttalib told each son to get an arrow and write his own name upon it and then to bring it to him.  This  they  did,  after  which  he  took  them  to  the  Ka'bah  where  there was  a  man  whose  special  task  it  was  to  cast  arrows  and  pick  one  from among  them.  This  man  solemnly  proceeded  to  do  this.  On  the arrow he chose was written the name of 'Abd Allah, the youngest and favorite son of 'Abd al-Muttalib. Even so, the father took his son near the Ka'bah and prepared to sacrifice him. Many of the Quraysh leaders were present and they became very angry because 'Abd Allah was very young and much loved by everyone. They tried to think of a way to save his life. Someone suggested that the advice of a wise old woman who lived in Yathrib should be sought, and so 'Abd al-Muttalib took his son and went to see if she could decide what to do. Some of the Meccans went with them and when they got there the woman asked, 'What is the price of a man's life?'  They told her, 'Ten camels', for at that time if one man killed another, his family would have to give ten camels to the dead man's family in order to keep the peace among them. So the woman told them to go back to the Ka‟bah and draw lots between 'Abd  Allah  and  ten  camels.  If  the  camels  were  chosen,  they  were  to  be killed and the meat given to the poor. If 'Abd Allah was picked then ten more  camels  were  to  be  added  and  the lots  drawn  again  and  again  until they finally fell on the camels."

There  they  started  to  draw  lots  between  „Abd  Allah  and  the camels,  starting  with  ten  camels.  „Abd  al-Muttalib  prayed  to  Allah  to spare his son and everyone waited in silence for the result. The choice fell on „Abd Allah, so his father added ten more camels. Again the choice fell on  „Abd  Allah,  so  they  did  the  same  thing  again  and  again,  adding  ten camels  each  time.  Finally  they  reached  one  hundred  camels,  and  only then  did  the lot  fall  on  the  camels. „Abd  Allah  was saved  and  everyone was very happy. 'Abd al-Muttalib however, wanted to make sure that this was the true result  so  he  repeated  the draw three times  and  each  time  it fell on the camels. He then gave thanks to Allah that He had spared „Abd Allah's  life.  The  camels  were  sacrificed  and  there  was  enough  food  for the  entire  city,  even  the  animals  and  birds.  'Abd  Allah  grew  up  to  be  a handsome  young  man  and  his  father  eventually  chose  Aminah,  the daughter of Wahb, as a wife for him. It was a good match for she was the finest  of  Quraysh  women  and  'Abd  Allah  the best  of  the  men. He  spent several months with his wife but then he had to leave her and travel with one of the caravans to trade with Syria. On his way back to Mecca from Syria 'Abd Allah became ill and had to stop off in Yathrib to recover. The caravan,  however,  continued  on  its  way  and  arrived  back  in  Mecca without  him.  On  hearing  of  'Abd  Allah's  illness,  „Abd  al-Muttalib  sent another son, al-Hareth, to bring 'Abd Allah back to Mecca, but he was too late. When he arrived in Yathrib „Abd Allah was dead. Aminah was heart- broken to lose her husband and the father of the child she would soon give birth to. Only Allah knew that this orphan child would one day be a great Prophet."

                "The Elephant Refuses To Move": "Abrahah,  who  came  from  Abyssinia-a  country  in  Africa-conquered Yemen and was made vice-regent there. Later, he noticed that at a certain time  of  the  year  large  numbers  of  people  would  travel  from  all  over Yemen and the rest of Arabia to Mecca. He asked the reason for this and was told that they were going on pilgrimage to the Ka'bah. Abrahah hated the  idea  of  Mecca  being  more  important  than  his  own  country,  so  he decided  to  build  a  church  of  colored  marble,  with  doors  of  gold  and ornaments  of  silver,  and  ordered  the  people  to  visit  it  instead  of  the Ka'bah. But no one obeyed him. Abrahah  became  angry  and  decided  to  destroy  the  Ka1bah.  He prepared  a  large  army  led  by  an  elephant  and  set  off  towards  Mecca. When  the  Meccans  heard  that  he  was  coming  they  became  very frightened. Abrahah's army was huge and they could not fight it. But how could they let him destroy the Holy Ka'bah? They went to ask the advice of their leader, 'Abd al-Muttalib.  When Abrahah arrived outside Mecca, 'Abd  al-Muttalib  went  to  meet  him.  Abrahah  said,  'What  do  you  want?' Abrahah had taken Abd al-Muttalib's camels, which he had found grazing as  he  entered  Mecca,  so  „Abd  al-Muttalib  replied,  'I  want  my  camels back.' Abrahah was very surprised and said, 'I have come to destroy your Holy Ka‟bah, the holy place of your fathers, and you ask me about some camels?' 'Abd al-Muttalib replied calmly, „The camels belong to me; the Ka‟bah belongs to Allah and He will protect it.' Then he left Abrahah and went back to Quraysh and ordered them to leave Mecca and wait for their enemies in the mountains. In the morning Abrahah prepared to enter the town. He put armor on his elephant and drew up his troops for battle. He intended to destroy the Ka'bah and then return to Yemen. At that moment, however, the elephant knelt down and refused to get up, no matter how much the soldiers tried to get it to move by beating it. But  when  they  turned  its  face  in  the  direction  of  Yemen  it immediately  got  up and  started  off.  In  fact, it  did the same in  any other direction,  but  as  soon  as  they  pointed  it  towards  Mecca  it  knelt  down again.  Suddenly,  flocks  of  birds  appeared  from  over  the  sea.  Each  bird carried three stones as small as peas and they dropped them on Abrahah1s army. The soldiers suddenly fell ill. Even Abrahah was hit by the stones and fled in fear with the rest of his army back to Yemen, where he later died.  On  seeing  their  enemy  flee  the  Arabs  came  down  from  the mountains to the Ka‟bah and gave thanks to Allah.      After  this,  Quraysh  gained  great  respect  and  became  known  as  'the people of Allah', and the year in which these events took place, 570A.D, was  named  the  'Year  of  the  Elephant'.  In  that  year  Allah  had  saved  the Ka'bah and he would soon bring forth a Prophet from among Quraysh. In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful: “Hast thou not seen how thy  Lord  dealt  with  the  owners  of  the  Elephant?  Did  He  not  bring  their stratagem  to  naught, And  send  against  them  swarms  of  flying creatures, Which pelted them with stones of baked clay, And made them like green crops devoured (by cattle)? (Qur'an 105.1-5)."

                "The Prophet Is Born": "One day, while travelling north, one of the Arab tribes from Mecca met a hermit in the desert. Some of the men stopped to speak with him. Hermits were  known  to  be  wise  and  the  Arabs  often  asked  their  advice.  The hermit  asked  where  they  had  come  from.  When  they  replied  that  they were  from  Mecca,  he  told  them  that  Allah  would  soon  send  a  prophet, who would come from their people. They asked the name of this prophet and the hermit answered that his name would be Muhammad and that he would guide them to a new way of life. Meanwhile  in  Mecca,  Aminah,  although  saddened  by  the  loss  of  her husband,  felt  especially  well  and  strong  as  she  awaited  the  birth  of  her baby. During this time she dreamt of many things. On one occasion it was as  if  a  great  light  were  shining  out  of  her,  and  on  another  she  heard  a voice telling her that she would have a boy and that his name would be Muhammad. She never forgot that voice but she told no one about it. On  Monday,  the  twelfth  day  of  Rabi  al-Awwal  in  the  Year  of  the Elephant, Aminah gave birth to a son. Allah sends man many signs when one  of  His  chosen  Prophets  is  born  and  on  that  twelfth  day  of  Rabi  al- Awwal in the year 570 A.D, many such signs were seen. Some were seen by Jewish scholars who had read in their scriptures of a coming Prophet. One of these learned men in Yathrib, for instance, saw a brilliant new star he had never seen before as he studied the heavens that night. He called the  people  around  him  and,  pointing  the  star  out  to  them,  told  them  a Prophet must have been born. That same night another Jew was passing by the meeting place of the leaders of Quraysh in Mecca. He asked them if  a  baby  boy  had  just  been  born  and  told  them  that  if  it  were  true,  this would be the Prophet of the Arab nation. Aminah sent news of the birth to her father-in-law, 'Abd al-Muttalib, who was sitting near the Ka'bah at the time. He was very happy and began at once to think of a name for the boy. An ordinary name would not do. Six days came and went and still he had not decided. But on the seventh day, as he lay asleep near the Ka‟bah, 'Abd al-Muttalib dreamt that he should give  the  baby  the  unusual  name  of  Muhammad,  just  as  Aminah  herself had  dreamt.  And  the  child  was  called  Muhammad  (pbuh),  which  means 'the  Praised  One'.  When  'Abd  al-Muttalib  told  the  leaders  of  Quraysh what he had named his grandson, many of them asked, 'Why did you not     choose the sort of name that is used by our people?' At once he replied, 'I want  him  to  be  praised  by  Allah  in  the  heavens  and  praised  by  men  on earth."

                "A Time With Halimah": "Like many other women in Mecca, Aminah decided to send her son away from the city for his early years to the desert where it was more healthy. Women from the desert used to come to Mecca to collect the new babies and they would then keep them until they developed into strong children, for which they were well paid by the parents. Among the women who traveled to Mecca to fetch a new baby at the time  Aminah's  son  was  born,  was  a  Bedouin  woman  called  Halimah. With her was her husband and baby son. They had always been very poor but this year things were harder than ever because there had been famine. The donkey that earned Halimah on the journey was so weak from hunger that he often stumbled. Halimah's own baby son cried all the time because his mother could not feed him properly. Even their she-camel did not give them one drop of milk. Halimah did not know what to do. She thought to herself, 'How can I possibly feed another baby when I haven't got enough milk even for my own son?' At last they reached Mecca. All the other women of the tribe to which Halimah belonged, the Bani Sa'd, found a child to take back with them, but not Halimah. The only baby left was Muhammad (pbuh). Usually the father  paid  the  wet-nurse  but  Mohammed‟s  father  was  dead.  So  no  one wanted to take him, even though he was from one of the noblest families of Quraysh. Halimah did not want to take him either, but she did not want to be the only woman to go back to her tribe without a baby to bring up. She  asked  her  husband  whether  she  should  take  Muhammad  (pbuh)  or not. He advised her to do so, adding, 'Perhaps Allah will bless us because of him.'  They started on the return journey and as soon as Halimah began to  feed  Muhammad  (pbuh)  her  milk  suddenly  increased  and  she  had enough  for  him  as  well  as  her  baby  son.  When  they  were  back  home, everything began to change. The land became green, and the date trees, one of their main sources of food, gave lots of fruit. Even the sheep and their old she-camel began to give plenty of milk. Halimah  and  her  husband  knew  that  this  good  fortune  had  come because  they  had  the  new  baby,  Muhammad  (pbuh),  whom  they  had come to love as if he were their own son. When Muhammad (pbuh) was two years old, Halimah took him back to his mother. She pleaded with Aminah, however, to let her keep him for      a  little  longer,  and  to  her  great  joy  the  mother  agreed.  During  his  time with Halimah's family in the desert, Muhammad (pbuh)  played with her children  and  together  they  would  take  the  sheep  out  to  graze.  At  other times, however, Halimah would often find him sitting alone. It is said that on one occasion, two angels came to Muhammad (pbuh) and washed his heart with snow. In this way Allah made his heart pure for He intended Muhammad (pbuh) to be greater than any man ever born and to become the Seal of the Prophets. In the Name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful “Did We not expand thy breast for thee And eased thee of thy burden Which  weighed  down  thy  back;  And  exalted  thy  fame?    So  truly  with hardship comes ease, Truly with hardship comes ease. So when thou art relieved, still toil And strive to please thy Lord. (Qur'an 94.1-8) When  Halimah  finally  took  Muhammad  (pbuh)  back  to  Aminah,  he was a healthy, strong boy. Later he would look back with joy on the time he had spent with  Halimah,  and he always thought of himself as one of the Bani Sa'd."

                "The Orphan's Childhood": "Muhammad  (pbuh)  returned  to  live  with  his  mother  in  Mecca  when  he was about three years old. Three years later Aminah decided to take her son to visit his uncles in Yathrib. She told her maid, Barakah, to prepare everything  they  would  need  for  the  long  journey,  and  then  they  joined one  of  the  caravans  going  there.  They  stayed  in  Yathrib  a  month  and Muhammad (pbuh) enjoyed the visit with his cousins. The climate there was very pleasant and he learned to swim and to fly a kite. On their way back to Mecca, however, Aminah became ill and died. She was buried in the village at al-Abwa not far from Yathrib. Muhammad (pbuh) returned sadly to Mecca with his mother's maid He was now six years old and had lost both his father and mother. He was then adopted by his grandfather, „Abd  al-Muttalib,  who  loved  him  dearly  and  kept  him  by  his  side  at  all times. It was the custom of 'Abd al-Muttalib to sit on a blanket near the Ka‟bah.  There  he  was  always  surrounded  by  people  who  had  come  to speak  to  him.  No  one  was  allowed  to  sit  on  the  blanket  with  him, however,  except  his  grandson  Muhammad  (pbuh),  which  shows  how close they were to each other. Many times 'Abd al-Muttalib was heard to say: 'This boy will be very important one day.' Two  years  later  'Abd  al-Muttalib  became  ill  and  Muhammad  (pbuh) stayed  by  him  constantly.  'Abd  al-Muttalib  told  his  son,  Abu  Talib,  to adopt  Muhammad  (pbuh)  after  his  death,  which  he  did.  Abu  Talib  had many  children  of  his  own,  but  Muhammad  (pbuh)  immediately  became part  of  his  family  and  the  favorite  child.  The  time  came  for  Quraysh  to prepare a caravan to go to Syria. Abu Talib was going with them and he took  Muhammad  (pbuh)  along.  It  was  Mohammed‟s  first journey  to  the north. After days of travel, the caravan arrived at a place near Syria where the Romans used to come to trade with the Arabs. Near this marketplace lived  a  monk  called  Bahira‟.  His  cell  had  been  used  by  generations  of monks before him and contained ancient manuscripts. Bahira'  saw  the  caravan  in  the  distance  and  was  amazed  to  see  that over it was a large white cloud. It was the only cloud in a clear blue sky and  it  appeared  to  be  shading  one  of  the  travelers.  The  monk  was  even more  surprised  to  see  that  the  cloud  seemed  to  follow  the  caravan  but disappeared  when  the  person  it  was  shading  sat  down  under  a  tree. Bahira‟  knew  from  the  scriptures  that  a  prophet  was  expected  to  come after  Jesus  and  it  had  been  his  wish  to  see  this  prophet  before  he  died. Realizing that what he had just seen was a miracle, he began to think that his wish might, after all, come true.     The monk sent an invitation to the Meccans to come and eat with him. The Arabs were surprised because they often passed by and Bahira‟ had never invited them before. When the group was all together for the meal, the  monk  said,  'Is  this  everyone?‟  'No',  someone  said,  'a  boy  was  left watching the camels.' Bahira‟ insisted that the boy should join them. The boy  was Muhammad  (pbuh). When  he  arrived  Bahira‟  said nothing, but watched  him  all  through  the  meal.  He  noticed  many  things  about  his appearance which fitted the description in the old manuscripts. Later on he took him aside and asked Muhammad (pbuh) many questions. He soon found out how he felt about the idols in the Ka'bah. When Bahira tried to make  him  swear  by  them,  as  the  Arabs  used  to  do,  Muhammad  (pbuh) said, 'There is nothing in this world that I hate more'. They talked together about Allah and about Mohammed‟s life and family. What was said made Bahira certain that this was indeed the Prophet who would follow Jesus. Then the monk went to Abu Talib and asked him how he was related to  Muhammad  (pbuh).  Abu  Talib  told  him  that  Muhammad  (pbuh)  was his  son.  Bahira  replied  that  this  could  not  be  so  because  the  boy  was destined to grow up an orphan, and he ordered Abu Talib to watch over Muhammad  (pbuh)  with  great  care.  There  are  many  stories  told  about Mohammed‟s youth. Some tell of how he used to take the family's sheep to  graze  and  was  always  kind  to  them.  While  they  grazed  he  would  sit thinking  about  the  mysteries  of  nature.  Unlike  those  around  him1  he never worshipped the idols and never swore by them. He also wondered why people were always struggling for power and money, and this saddened him and made him feel lonely, but he kept his feelings  to  himself.  He  was  a  quiet,  thoughtful  boy,  and  rarely  played with  other  boys  of  his  age.  On  one  occasion,  however,  Muhammad (pbuh)  went  with  some  of  the  boys  to  a  wedding  in  Mecca.  When  he reached the house he heard the sounds of music and dancing but just as he was about to enter he suddenly felt tired and, sitting down, fell asleep. He didn't  wake  up  until  late  the  next  morning  and  thus  missed  the celebrations.  In  this  way  Allah  prevented  him  from  doing  anything foolish for He was keeping Muhammad (pbuh) for something much more important."

                "The Prophet's Marriage": "By  the  time  Muhammad  (pbuh)  was  twenty-five  he  was  famous  for  his honesty.  He  was  respected  by  everyone,  even  the  elders  of  Mecca.  The purity  of  his  nature  increased  with  the  years.  It  seemed  he  had  an  inner knowledge  that  other  people  did  not  have.  He  believed  in  one  God- Creator of the world-and he worshipped Him with all his heart and with all  his  soul.  Muhammad  (pbuh)  was  the  finest  of  his  people,  the  most kind,  truthful  and  reliable  person  in  Mecca.  He  was  known  among Quraysh  as  'the  trustworthy'  (al-Amin)  because  of  the  good  qualities Allah had given him. He spent many quiet hours in a cave in Mount Hira, not  far  from  Mecca,  thinking  about  Allah.  Among  Quraysh  was  a respected  and  wealthy  woman  named  Khadijah.  She  was  involved  in trade and on hearing of Mohammed‟s reputation, sent for him and asked him to take her goods and trade with them in Syria. Muhammad (pbuh) agreed and left for Syria with one of Khadijah's caravans. With him went her slave, Maysarah, and they spent a great deal of time talking together. Maysarah  soon  came  to  admire  Muhammad  (pbuh).  He  thought  he  was quite different from all the other men of Quraysh. Two  unusual  events  took  place  during  this  journey  which  puzzled Maysarah very much. The first happened when they stopped to rest near the  lonely  home  of  a  monk.  Muhammad  (pbuh)  sat  under  a  tree  while Maysarah  was  busy  with  some  work.  The  monk  came  up  to  Maysarah and asked, 'Who is the man resting under the tree?' 'One of Quraysh, the people  who  guard  the  Ka‟bah',  said  Maysarah.  'No  one  but  a  Prophet  is sitting beneath this tree', replied the monk. The second event occurred on the  journey  back  to  Mecca.  It  happened  at  noon,  when  the  sun  is  at  its hottest.  Maysarah  was  riding  behind  Muhammad  (pbuh)  and  as  the  sun grew  hotter  he  saw  two  angels  appear  above  Muhammad  (pbuh)  and shield him from the sun's harmful rays. The trading was very successful and Muhammad (pbuh) made more profit for Khadijah than she had ever received before. When they arrived back in Mecca Maysarah told Khadijah everything about the trip and what he had noticed about Mohammed‟s character and behavior. Khadijah  was  a  widow  in  her  forties  and  as  well  as  being  rich  and highly respected she was also very beautiful. Many  men  wanted  to  marry  her  but  none  of  them  suited  her.  When she  met  Muhammad  (pbuh),  however,  she  thought  he  was  very  special. She  sent  a  friend  to  ask  Muhammad  (pbuh)  why  he  was  not  married. Muhammad  (pbuh)  said  that it was because  he  had  no  money, to  which the  friend  replied:  'Supposing  a  rich,  beautiful  and  noble  lady  agreed  to     marry you?' Muhammad (pbuh) wanted to know who that could be. The friend  told  him  it  was  Khadijah.  Muhammad  (pbuh)  was  very  happy, because  he  greatly  respected  Khadijah.  He  went  with  his  uncles,  Abu Talib  and  Hamzah,  to  Khadijah's  uncle,  and  asked  his  permission  to marry  her.  The  uncle  gave  his  permission  and  soon  after,  Muhammad (pbuh) and Khadijah were married. Their marriage was a joyful one and Muhammad (pbuh) and Khadijah were  well  suited.  Their  life  together,  however,  was  not  without  some sadness.  They  were  blessed  with  six  children,  two  sons  and  four daughters. Sadly their first born, a son called Qasim, died shortly before his second birthday, and their last child, also a son, only lived for a short time.  Happily,  their  four  daughters-Zaynab,  Ruqayyah,  Umm  Kulthum, and Fatimah-all survived. For  a  few  years  Muhammad  (pbuh)  lived  a  calm  and  quiet  life  as  a merchant  in  Mecca.  His  wisdom  benefited  many  people.  One  such  time was  when  Quraysh  decided  to  rebuild  the  Ka‟bah.  It  was  a  difficult decision for them because they had to knock it down before rebuilding it and  the  people  were  afraid  that  Allah  might  be  angry  with  them  for knocking down His sanctuary. At last one of the wise old men of Quraysh decided to begin, then everybody followed him. They worked until they reached down to the first foundation that Abraham had built. As soon as they began to remove the stones of this foundation, however, the whole of Mecca began to shake. They were so afraid that they decided to leave these stones where they were and build on top of them. Each tribe brought stones and they built the Ka'bah up until they reached the place where the black stone was to be  set.  They  then  began  to  argue  about  who  should  have  the  honor  of carrying the black stone and lifting it to its place in one of the corners of the Ka'bah. They almost came to blows but fortunately one of the men offered a solution.  He  suggested  that  they  should  be  guided  by  the  first  person  to enter  the  place  of  worship.  They  all  agreed  and  as  Muhammad  (pbuh) was the first to enter everyone was pleased, because they all trusted him. They  told  him  the  cause  of  the  argument  and  he  asked  them  to  bring  a large  cloak.  They  did  as  he  asked,  and  after  spreading  the  cloak  on  the ground he placed the black stone in the centre of it. Then he asked a man from each tribe to hold one edge of the cloak and together to raise it to the   height  where  the  stone  should  be  see.  When  this  was  done,  he  took  the stone off the cloak and put it into place himself. This story shows how all Quraysh  respected  and  trusted  Muhammad  (pbuh)  and  how,  by  his wisdom and good sense, he was able to keep the peace."

                "The Coming of The Archangel Gabriel": "Muhammad  (pbuh)  believed  that  there  was  only  one  Allah,  Creator  of the sun, the moon, the earth, the sky, and of all living things, and that all people should worship only Him. Muhammad  (pbuh) would  often  leave the crowded city and go to the cave in Mount Hira'. He liked to be alone there,  away  from  all  thoughts  of  the  world  and  daily  life,  eating  and drinking  little.  In  his  fortieth  year,  Muhammad  (pbuh)  left  Mecca  to spend  Ramadan,  the  traditional  month  of  retreat,  in  the  cave.  In  the second half of Ramadan, Allah began to reveal His message for mankind through  Muhammad  (pbuh).  This  first  Revelation  occurred  as  follows. The  Archangel  Gabriel  came  to  Muhammad  (pbuh)  in  the  cave  and commanded him to 'Read'. Muhammad (pbuh) replied 'I cannot read.' At this the Archangel took Muhammad (pbuh) in his arms and pressed him to  him  until  it  was  almost  too  much  to  bear.  He  then  released  him  and said  again  'Read.'  'I  cannot',  replied  Muhammad  (pbuh),  at  which  the Archangel  embraced  him  again.  For  the  third  time  the  Archangel commanded Muhammad (pbuh) to read, but still he said he could not and was again embraced. On releasing him this time, however, the Archangel Gabriel said: “Read:  In  the  Name  of  thy  Lord  who  createth,  Createth  man  from  a clot. Read: And thy Lord is the Most Generous Who teacheth by the pen, Teacheth  man  that  which  he  knew  not.  (Qur'an  96.1-5)  Muhammad (pbuh) repeated these verses, just as the Archangel had said them. When the  Archangel  was  sure  Muhammad  (pbuh)  knew  them  by  heart,  he  we away.  Now  that  he  was  alone  Muhammad  (pbuh)  could  not  understand what had happened to him. He was terribly afraid and rushed out of the cave. Perhaps the cave was haunted? Perhaps the devil had taken a hold of his mind? But he was stopped by a voice from heaven which said; '0 Muhammad  (pbuh)  you  are  the  Messenger  of  Allah,  and  I  am  Gabriel.' He  looked  up  at  the  sky  and  wherever  he  turned  he  saw  the  Archangel Gabriel. In  a  state  of  confusion  he  returned  home  to  Khadijah.  When  his  wife saw him she became very worried as he began to shiver, as though in a fever. He asked her to wrap him in blankets, which she did. After a while he recovered sufficiently to tell her what had happened at Hira'. Khadijah believed all that he told her and with great respect said: 'Be happy, 0 son of my uncle and be confident. Truly I swear by Allah who has my soul in His hands, that you will be our people's Prophet.' Muhammad (pbuh), the Messenger of Allah, was eased by her faith in him, but after all that had happened he was exhausted and felt fast asleep.     Khadijah left the Prophet (pbuh) sleeping and went to see her cousin, Waraqah  Ibn  Nawfal,  to  ask  him  what  he  thought  about  all  that  had happened. Waraqah was a very wise man who had read many books and had  become  a  Christian  after  studying  the  Bible.  He  told  Khadijah  that Muhammad (pbuh) had been chosen by Allah to be His Messenger. Just as the Archangel Gabriel had come to Moses before and had ordered him to guide his people, so, too, would Muhammad (pbuh) be the Prophet of his people. But Waraqah warned that all the people would not listen to the Prophet  and  some  would  mistreat  his  followers.  He  must,  however,  be patient because he had a great message for all the world. From that day on,  the  Archangel  Gabriel  came  often  to  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  the verses he taught him, the message from Allah to man, were later written down, and are known to us as the Holy Qur'an."

                "The First Muslimsr": "After  that  momentous  day  in  the  month  of  Ramadan,  Revelation  came again and again to the Prophet (pbuh). He understood now what he had to do and prepared himself for what was to come. Only a strong and brave man, helped by Allah, can be a true prophet because people often refuse to listen to Allah's message. Khadijah was the first to believe the Prophet (pbuh) and accept as true what he brought from Allah. Through her, Allah made  things  easier  for  the  Prophet  (pbuh).  Khadijah  strengthened  him, helped  him  spread  his  message,  and  stood  up  to  the  people  who  were against him. Then Revelation ceased for a time. The Prophet (pbuh) was upset and unhappy, thinking that Allah had left him, or that he might have angered Allah  in  some  way  so  that  Allah  no  longer  thought  him  worthy  of  His message. However, the Archangel Gabriel came back to him and brought this surah, or chapter, of the Qur'an: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “By the morning hours, And by the night when it is stillest, Thy Lord hath neither forsaken thee nor doth He hate thee, And verily the Last will be better for thee than the First. And verily thy Lord will give unto thee so that thou wilt be content. Did He not find thee an orphan and protect thee?  Did  He  not  find  thee  wandering  and  guide  thee?  Did  He  not  find thee  destitute  and  enrich  thee?    Therefore  the  orphan  oppress  not, Therefore  the  beggar  drive  not  away,  And  as  for  thy  Lord's  blessing, declare it”. (Qur'an: 93.1-11) The  Prophet  (pbuh)  began  to  speak  secretly  of  Allah's  message  to those  Who  were  close  to  him  and  whom  he  could  trust.  At  that  time Mecca  was  going  through  hard  times.  There  was  very  little  food  to  be had. Abu Talib, the Prophet's uncle, who had taken care of him after his grandfather's death, was finding it very difficult to feed his large family. The  Prophet  (pbuh)  said  that  he  and  another  uncle,  al-'Abbas,  who was a rich man, would each bring up one of Abu Talib's children in order to help him. The Prophet (pbuh) took „Ali and his uncle took Ja‟far. One day, when the Prophet (pbuh) was outside the city, the Archangel Gabriel  appeared  to  him.  The  Archangel  kicked  the  side  of  a  hill  and  a spring of water began to flow out. He then began to wash himself in the running water to show the Prophet (pbuh) the ritual ablution to be made before  prayer.  Then  the  Archangel  showed  him  all  the  positions  of Muslim  prayer-the  various  movements  and  things  to  be  said  with  each       movement. The Prophet (pbuh) returned home and taught all these things first  to  Khadijah  and  then  to  his  followers.  Since  then  Muslims  have continued  to  purify  themselves  before  prayer  by  performing  the  ritual ablution  and  have  followed  the  same  movements  and  prayers  first performed by the Prophet (pbuh). To begin with, though, only the Prophet (pbuh) and his wife knew of these things. Then one day „Ali entered the room  and  found  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  Khadijah  praying.  He  was puzzled and asked what they  were doing. The Prophet (pbuh) explained to him that they were praising Allah and giving thanks to Him. That night 'Ali stayed up thinking about all that the Prophet (pbuh) had said; he had great admiration and respect for his cousin. Finally he came to a decision and  the  next  day  he  went  to  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  told  him  that  he wanted  to  follow  him.  Thus  Khadijah  was  the  first  woman  to  embrace Islam,  the  teachings  which  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  brought  from  Allah,  and „Ali was the first young man. Shortly after they were joined by Zayd ibn Harithah, a slave, freed and adopted by the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophet (pbuh) began to leave Mecca with 'An in order to pray. One  day  Abu  Talib  happened  to  pass  by  and  when  he  saw  them  he stopped and asked them what  they were  doing. The Prophet (pbuh) told him that they were praying and following the same religion as Abraham. He explained that, like Abraham, he had been ordered to guide the people to Allah's truth. Abu Talib looked at his son, 'Ali, and said: 'Muhammad (pbuh) would never make you do anything that was wrong. Go with him. But I cannot leave the religion I now follow and which was followed by my father.' Then he turned to the Prophet (pbuh), saying, 'Even so, I promise  you,  Muhammad  (pbuh), that no  one will hurt you as  long  as  I am alive.' And with that Abu Talib went on his way. At about this time the  news  of  Muhammad  (pbuh)  being  the  Prophet  reached  an  honest, wise,  and  respected  merchant  of  Mecca  called  Abu  Bakr.  He  knew Muhammad  (pbuh)  well  and  believed  he  could  never  lie,  so  he  went  to find  out  for  himself  if  the story  were  true. The Prophet  (pbuh)  told  him that  he  had  indeed  been  sent  by  Allah  to  teach  everyone  to  worship  the one  true  Allah.  On  hearing  this  from  the  Prophet's  own  lips  Abu  Bakr knew it to be the truth and became a believer instantly. Later the Prophet (pbuh) was reported to have said that everyone he ever invited to accept Islam  showed  signs  of  disbelief  and  doubt,  except  Abu  Bakr;  when  he was  told  of  it  he  did  not  hold  back  or  hesitate.  Because  of  his  wisdom, honesty, and kindness people had always turned to Abu Bakr for advice. He was, therefore, a man of some influence and through him many people came  to  Islam.  Among  these  was  Sa'd  ibn  Abi  Waqqas  as,  the  uncle  of Aminah, the Prophet's mother. The night before Abu Bakr came to visit him  and  tell  him  about  Islam,  Sa'd  Ibn  Abi  Waqqas  dreamt  that  he  was   walking in darkness. As he walked he saw the moon and when he looked at  it  he  saw  'Ali,  Abu  Bakr,  and  Zayd,  the  Prophet's  freed  slave, beckoning to him to come and join them. When Abu Bakr told him about the Prophet's religion, he understood the meaning of his dream and went at  once  to  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  declared  himself  a  Muslim.  He understood that to be a Muslim  means to submit oneself to Allah's Will and to serve only Him. Another person brought to Islam by Abu Bakr was Bilal. One night Abu Bakr went to the house of Umayyah ibn Khalaf, one of the most important men of Quraysh. Umayyah was out and Abu Bakr found only Umayyah's slave, Bilal, at home. Abu Bakr talked to the slave about  Islam  and  before  he  left,  Bilal,  too,  had  become  a  Muslim.  The number  of  people  following  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  began  to  grow. Sometimes  they  would  all  go  out  of  the  city  to  the  mountains  around Mecca to hear him recite the Qur'an and to be taught by him. This was all done very secretly and only a very few people knew about Islam in those early days."

                "The Troubles Begin": "Three  years  passed  and  one  day  the  Archangel  Gabriel  came  to  the Prophet (pbuh) and ordered him to start preaching openly to everyone. So the Prophet (pbuh) told the people of Mecca that he had something very important to tell them. He stood on a hillside in Mecca, called Safa, and they  gathered  around  to  hear  what  he  had  to  say.  He  started  by  asking them if they would believe him were he to say that an army was about to attack  them.  They  answered  that  indeed  they  would,  because  he  never lied. He then told them that he was the Messenger of Allah, sent to show them the right way, and to warn them of terrible punishments if they did not  follow  him  in  worshipping  only  Allah  and  none  other.  Abu  Lahab, one of the Prophet's uncles who was among the listeners, suddenly stood up and said, 'May you perish! Did you call us here just to tell us this?' At this, Allah sent to the Prophet (pbuh) the following Surah: In the Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful “The Power of Abu Lahab will perish, and he will perish. His wealth and gains will not save him. He shall roast at a flaming fire, And his wife, the  carrier  of  firewood  Will  have  upon  her  neck  a  rope  of  palm-fibre”. (Qur'an 111.1-5) Then  the  crowd  dispersed  and  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  was  left  alone.  A few days later the Prophet (pbuh) tried again. A feast was prepared in his house for all of his uncles. After the meal he spoke to them and said, 'O sons of 'Abd al-Muttalib! I know of no Arab who has come to his people with  a  better  message  than  mine.  I  have  brought  you  the  best  news  for this life and the next. Allah has ordered me to call you to Him. So which of  you  will  help  me?'  All  the  men  kept  silent.  Then  'Ali,  his  cousin, jumped up and said: 'O Prophet of Allah! I will help you.' Then the men all got up and left, laughing as they went because only one young boy had agreed to help the Prophet (pbuh). His message ignored by most of the people and his uncles, the Prophet (pbuh)  continued  to  meet  his  friends  secretly  in  a  house  near  the  hill  of Safa. There they prayed together and he taught them about the religion of Islam.  But  even  though  they  kept  to  themselves,  they  were  sometimes abused  by  those  who  would  not  believe.  From  one  such  incident, however, an unexpected conversion to Islam took place. One day, when the Prophet  (pbuh) was returning  home,  speaking with  his followers, he met Abu Jahl, a leader of Quraysh, who hated the Prophet (pbuh) and his teachings. Abu Jahl started to insult him and to speak spitefully of Islam, but the Prophet (pbuh) made no reply and went on his way.     Later,  Hamzah,  one  of  the  Prophet's  uncles,  who  was  a  strong  and brave warrior of whom people were quite afraid, heard how his nephew had  been  insulted.  Filled  with  rage,  he  ran  straight  to  the  Ka'bah  where Abu Jahl was sitting among the people and struck him a violent blow in the face with his bow. Hamzah then shouted, 'Will you insult him when I follow  his  religion,  and  I  say  what  he  says?  Hit  me  back  if  you  can!' Some people got up to help Abu Jahl but he stopped them saying, 'Leave Hamzah alone, for by Allah, I have insulted his nephew badly. 'From that moment  on  Hamzah  followed  the  teachings  of  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and with his conversion to Islam Quraysh realized that the Prophet (pbuh) had a strong supporter and so for a while they stopped persecuting him. Soon, however, the leaders of Quraysh became angry again, when they saw that the Prophet (pbuh) was going ahead with his teaching. A group of them went to his uncle, Abu Talib, who had promised to protect him. They told him to ask the Prophet (pbuh) to stop attacking their gods and their way of life, and in return they would let him do as he wished with his religion. After a time they saw that there was no change, so they went back to Abu Talib and this time they told him that if he did not stop his nephew, they  would  fight  them  both.  Abu  Talib  was  very  upset  by  this  quarrel among his people, but he could not break his word to his nephew. He sent for  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  told  him  what  had  happened,  saying,  'Spare me and spare yourself; do not put a greater burden on me than I can bear.' The Prophet (pbuh) thought that his uncle might abandon him and that he would  no  longer  have  his  support,  but  nevertheless  he  answered,  '0  my uncle, by Allah, if they put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left  in  return  for  my  giving  up  this  cause,  I  would  not  give  it  up  until Allah  makes  Truth  victorious,  or  I  die  in  His  service.  Abu  Talib  was deeply moved by this answer. He told the Prophet (pbuh) that he would support  him  for  as  long  as  he  lived  and  encouraged  him  to  go  on spreading Allah's message. From that time on, however hard the leaders of Quraysh tried to convince Abu Talib to stop protecting his nephew, he always refused to listen to them. In order to get rid of the Prophet (pbuh) and  his  followers,  his  enemies  started  persecuting  those  Muslims  who were  poor  or  weak,  or  had  no  powerful  friends.  One  such  person  was Bilal, the slave of Umayyah ibn Khalaf. His  master would take him out into the desert, tie him up, and leave him in the sun with a large stone on his  chest.  Fortunately  Abu  Bakr  was  passing  by  one  day  and  saw Umayyah  torturing  Bilal,  so  he  bought  him  from  his  master  for  a  large sum of money and then set him free. But not all persecuted Muslims were as fortunate as Bilal. Many suffered, but all of them endured it patiently, knowing that they were doing the right thing and that their reward in the life  to  come  would  be  greater'  than  any  happiness  they  could  find  on earth."

                "The King Who Believed": "As the number of the Prophet's followers increased so the enemies of the Muslims  grew  more  and  more  angry.  At  last  some  of  the  Muslims decided to go to another country in order to live in peace. It was only five years  since  the  Archangel  Gabriel  had  first  come  to  the  Prophet  (pbuh) and  two  years  since  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  had  spoken  out  in  public.  The Muslims  asked  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  to  allow  them  to  leave  Mecca.  He agreed,  saying  'It  would  be  better  for  you  to  go  to  Abyssinia.  The  king there  is  a  just  man  and  it  is  a  friendly  country.  Stay  there  until  Allah makes  it  possible  for  you  to  return.  The  Muslims  prepared  for  the journey. They decided to wait until night so that they could leave without being  seen.  The  first  sixteen left  Mecca  and,  after  reaching  the shore  of die  Red  Sea,  crossed  over  to  Abyssinia.  Another  eighty-three  men  and nineteen  women  followed,  all  hoping  to  be  welcomed  by  the  king  and people of that country. This was the first hijrah, or migration, in Islam. The Meccans were furious when they discovered that these Muslims had secretly left the city for among them were the sons and daughters of many  of  the  leading  families  of  Mecca.  The  anger  of  the  Meccans  was even  greater  when  they  found  out  that  the  Muslims  had  been  warmly welcomed in Abyssinia. The leaders of Quraysh decided to send two men to the Abyssinian king in hopes of persuading him to send the Muslims back. These were 'Amr ibn al-'As, a very clever speaker, and „Abd Allah ibn abi Rabi‟ah. Before they met this king, they gave each of his advisers a gift, saying: 'Some foolish men from our people have come to hide in your  country. Our  leaders  have  sent  us  to  your  ruler  to  persuade  him to send them back, so when we speak to the king about them, do advise him to  give  them  up  to  us.'  The  advisers  agreed  to  do  what  the  Meccans wished. Amr ibn al-'As and 'Abd Allah ibn abi Rabi'ah then went to the king and presented him also with a gift, saying: 'Your Highness, these people have abandoned the religion we have always followed in Mecca, but they have not even become Christians like you.' The royal advisers, who were also present, told the king that the Meccans had spoken the truth and that he  should  send  the  Muslims  back  to  their  own  people.  At  this,  the  king became angry and said, 'No, by God, I will not give them up. Those who have come to ask for my protection, settled in my country, and chosen me rather  than  others,  shall  not  be  betrayed.  I  will  summon  them  and  ask them  about  what  these  two  men  have  said.  If  the  Muslims  are  as  the Meccans say, I will give them up and send them back to their own people, but if the Meccans have lied I will protect the Muslims.' 'Amr was very     upset by this for the last thing he wanted was for the king to hear what the Muslims  had  to  say.  The  king  then  sent  for  the  Muslims.  When  they entered,  they  did  not  kneel  before  him  as  was  the  custom  of  the Abyssinians. 'Why do you not kneel before our king?' they were asked by one  of  the  advisors.  'We  kneel  only  to  Allah',  they  replied.  So  the  king asked them to tell him about their religion. Ja'far ibn abi Talib, Ali's brother and a cousin of the Prophet (pbuh), was chosen to speak for the Muslims. He replied, '0 King, at first we were among  the  ignorant.  We  and  our  ancestors  had  turned  from  the  faith  of Abraham,  who,  with  Ishmael,  rebuilt  the  Ka‟bah  and  worshipped  only Allah. We used idols in our worship of Allah; we  ate meat that had not been  killed  in  the  right  way;  we  did  not  respect  the  rights  of  our neighbors; the strong took advantage of the weak. We did terrible things of which I dare not speak. This was our life until Allah sent a Messenger from among us, one of our relatives, whom we have always known to be honest, innocent, and faithful. He asked us to worship only Allah, and to give up the bad customs of our forefathers. He asked us to be truthful and trustworthy, to respect and help our neighbors, to honor our families, and to put a stop to our bad deeds and endless fighting. He asked us to look after  orphans.  He  ordered  us  not  to  slander  or  speak  evil  of  women  or men. He  ordered  us  to  worship  Allah  alone  and  not  to  worship  anyone  or anything else alongside Him. He ordered us to pray, to give alms, and to fast. We believe he is right and therefore we follow him and do as he has commanded us. The  Meccans  began  to  attack  us  and  come  between  us  and  our religion. So we had to leave our homes and we have come to you, hoping to find justice.' The king, who was a Christian, was moved by these words. „Amr had to think quickly of a way to win the argument. Cunningly he said to the king, 'These people do not believe in Jesus in the same way as you'. The king then wanted to know what the Prophet (pbuh) had said about Jesus. Ja'far replied by reciting a Surah from the Qur'an which tells the story of Jesus and his mother Mary. These are a few of the lines he recited: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “And  make  mention  of  Mary  in  the  Scripture,  when  she  had Withdrawn  from  her  people  to  an  eastern  place,  And  had  chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our spirit and it assumed for her  the  likeness  of  a  perfect  man.  She  said:  Lo!  I  seek  refuge  in  the   Beneficent  One  from  thee,  if  Thou  fearest  God.  He  said:  I  am  only  a messenger  of  thy  Lord,  that  I  may  bestow  on  thee  a  faultless  son.  She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither have I been unchaste? He said: 'Even so thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that We may make of him revelation for mankind and a mercy from  Us,  and  it  is  a  thing  ordained.  And  she  conceived  him,  and  she withdrew with him to a far place. Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying  him.  They  said:  O  Mary!  Thou  hast  come  with  an  monstrous thing. Oh sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother  a  harlot.  Then  Mary  pointed  to  the  child  (Jesus);  But  they  said, 'How can  we speak to one who is still in the cradle, a young child?' He said, 'Lo, I am Allah's servant; He has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. He has made me Blessed, wheresoever I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so long as I live, and likewise to cherish my mother; he has not made me arrogant, unblest Peace be upon me, the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I am raised up alive!” (Qur'an :-) . When the king heard this, his eyes filled with tears. Turning to his advisers, he said, 'These words have surely come from God; there is very little to separate the Muslims from the Christians. What both Jesus and Muhammad, the Messengers of Allah, have brought comes from the same source. So the Muslims were given the king's permission to live peacefully in his country. 'Amr was given back the gift he had presented to the king and the two Meccans returned home, bitterly disappointed."

                "The Cruelty of Quraysh": "The leaders of Quraysh became increasingly worried about the way the people of Mecca were being divided by the Prophet's teachings. Finally, „Umar ibn al-Khattab, one of the nobles of Mecca, decided that the only way  to  silence  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  was  to  kill  him.  Having  made  up  his mind, he set out at once to look for him. On his way he met a man who saw at once what „Umar was going to do and said: 'Why don't you look a little  closer  to  home  before  going  to  kill  Muhammad?  Don't  you  know your own sister Fatimah is a Muslim?' 'Umar was shocked. He could not believe  this  was  true.  He  went  at  once  to  his  sister's  house.  When  he arrived outside the house he heard Fatimah and her husband Sa‟id reading aloud surah Ta Ha, a chapter from the Qur'an. Hearing her brother's voice at  the  door,  Fatimah  quickly  hid  the  scroll  with  the  surah  written  on  it among  the  folds  of  her  dress.  „Umar  stormed  into  the  room  and demanded,  'What  is  this  nonsense  I  heard?'  Fatimah  denied  everything. „Umar  then  lost  his  temper  and  attacked  Fatimah's  husband  shouting, 'They  tell  me  that  you  have  joined  Muhammad  in  his  religion!' Fatimah tried  to  defend  her  husband  and  „Umar  hit  her  too.  Then  she  admitted, „Yes,  we  are  Muslims  and  we  believe  in  Allah  and  His  Messenger  and you can do what you like!' Seeing  her  faith  and  courage, „Umar  suddenly  felt  sorry  for  what  he had done and said to his sister, 'Let me see what I heard you reading just now  so  that  I  may  understand  just  what  it  is  that  your  Prophet  has brought.  Fatimah  gave  the  scroll  to  him  after  he  had  washed  to  make himself  clean  and  pure  before  touching  it,  and  had  promised  to  give  it back to her afterwards. In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “Ta Ha We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) this Qur'an For thee  to  be  distressed,  but  only  as  a  reminder  Unto  him  who  fears  a Revelation  from  Him  who  created  the  earth  and  the  high  heavens;  the Beneficent  One  Who  is  established  on  the  Throne;  To  Him  belongs Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth And all that is between them, and All that is underneath the soil. If  Thou  speakest  aloud  Be  thou  loud  in  thy  speech,  yet  Surely  He knows the secret (thought) And that yet more hidden. Allah There is no god but He To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names”. (Qur'an 20: 1-8) . As  he  read,  'Umar  suddenly  knew  that  these  were  the  most  beautiful words he had ever heard and that this religion must be the true one. With his  sword  still  in  hand,  he  went  straight  to  the  Prophet's  house  and     knocked loudly at the door. One of the Prophet's closest followers looked out.  There  stood  'Umar  who  was  known  for  his  courage  and  strength. When he saw 'Umar so excited and with his sword in hand, he was afraid for the Prophet's life. But the Prophet (pbuh) asked him to allow 'Umar to come  in  and  to  leave  them  alone  together.  The  Prophet  (pbuh)  asked 'Umar why he had come, to which he replied: 'I have come to swear that there is no god but Allah and that you, Muhammad, are the Messenger of Allah.' As he spoke these words, his hand still held the sword with which he had intended to kill the Prophet (pbuh). This same sword' would now be used to defend the Prophet (pbuh) and the faith of Islam. At that time, whenever Muslims wanted to perform the ritual encircling of the Ka'bah, known  as  tawaf  they  had  to  do  it  secretly  and  in  fear.  'Umar,  however, was  very  courageous.  As  soon  as  he  had  declared  his  faith,  he  went directly  to  the  Ka'bah  and  in  broad  daylight  made  the  circling  of  the Sacred  House  before  the  astonished  people  of  Mecca.  No  one  dared  to say anything. But now the leaders of Quraysh became even more alarmed and began to see Islam as a threat to the whole life of the city of Mecca. They grew more and more furious as the numbers of Muslims increased until finally they, too, decided as 'Umar once had, that the Prophet (pbuh) would have to be killed. On  hearing  of the  Prophet's  uncle, these  plans,  Abu  Talib, immediately  sent  a  message  to  all  the  sons  of  'Abd  al-Muttalib,  asking them to protect their nephew, and this they agreed to do. When Quraysh realized  that  they  could  not  kill  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  because  of  this protection,  they  decided  instead  to  avoid  him  and  his  followers completely. A declaration to this effect was hung at the Ka‟bah. It stated that  no  one  in  the  city  was  allowed  to  have  anything  to  do  with  the Prophet  (pbuh)  and  his  people,  or  even  to  sell  them  any  food  or  drink whatsoever. At first the Muslims found some support among the Bani Hashim, the branch of Quraysh to which the Prophet (pbuh) belonged. Some of these people  were  not  Muslims  but  showed  loyalty  to  their  kinsmen  by suffering  along  with  them.  However,  life  grew  more  and  more  difficult and food was scarce. The hatred of the rest of Quraysh for the followers of  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  grew  so  great  that  when  his  companions  tried  to buy  supplies  from  a  caravan  passing  near  to  Mecca,  Abu  Lahab, one of the  Muslims'  worst  enemies,  offered  ten  times  the  price  of  the  goods  to the  merchant.  By  doing  this  he  managed  to  stop  the  Muslims,  from buying  what  they  desperately  needed.  During  the  years  of  this  terrible treatment,  a  wonderful  thing  happened.  Instead  Of  Islam  becoming weaker, it grew stronger. Allah sent more and more Revelations. It was as though  the  Muslims  were  being  strengthened  and  cleansed  by  the   hardships they suffered and were being tested in their faith. Each year at the  time  of  the  pilgrimage  to  Mecca,  people  tame  from  all  over  Arabia. These pilgrims saw the terrible cruelty and injustice of Quraysh towards the  Muslims,  and  many  of  them  were  sorry  for  the  Prophet's  followers. Quraysh  began  to  feel  ashamed  of  their  harsh  treatment,  especially  as many  of  the  Muslims  were  their  cousins  and  close  relatives.  Finally,  at the end of three years, they were convinced that the time had come to put an end to the persecution of the Muslims, and they decided to take down the  notice  hanging  at  the  Ka‟bah.  To  their  astonishment,  the  sheet  of paper had been completely eaten up by worms, all except the words, 'In Your  Name,  O  Allah',  which  had  been  written  at  the  top  of  the  paper."

                "The Year of Sorrow": "The Prophet (pbuh) and his followers went back to a normal way of life but the years of hardship had made Khadijah very weak. She became ill and soon afterwards she died. Thus, the Prophet (pbuh) lost his beloved wife and friend, the first person to accept Islam and support him. She had been a refuge from all his troubles and, through her good-heartedness, the best  company  in  his  suffering.  He  had  loved  her  very  much.  This happened  in  619  A.D.,  the  year  which  became  known  as  the  'Year  of Sorrow'.  Soon  after  this,  the  Prophet  Muhammad's  uncle  and  protector, Abu Talib, also died. Abu Talib had been one of the most respected men in Mecca-one of the elders of Quraysh. Even though he had never been a follower  of  Islam,  he  had  protected  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  against  his enemies. Not only was this a sad occasion for the Prophet (pbuh) but also a  dangerous  one.  According  to  Arab  custom  anyone  who  is  under  the protection of another is safe so long as his protector lives. Now, with the death of his uncle, the Prophet's protection was gone. The  Prophet's  enemies  rejoiced  to  see  him  so  sad,  without  a  wife  to console  and  comfort  him,  and  without  his  uncle  to  protect  him.  They began  to  treat  him  worse than  ever  before. Even  small  children  insulted him. One young man actually threw some filth on the Prophet's head, but the Prophet (pbuh) went home without making anything of it. When one of  his  daughters  rushed,  weeping,  to  wash  it  away,  he  comforted  her saying,  'Do  not  weep  my  little  girl,  for  Allah  will  protect  your  father.' Abu  Talib  had  been  the  Prophet's  last  tie  with  Quraysh  and  the  Prophet (pbuh)  now  felt  that  Islam  could  make  no  further  progress  in  Mecca because  the  hearts  of  Quraysh  were  closed  against  him.  He  decided, therefore, to travel to Ta'if where he hoped to find support. He walked all the way to the town, which was seventy kilometers away. There he spoke in  all  the  places  where  people  gathered,  but  no  one  listened  to  him.  He met  the  leaders  of  the  three  most  important  tribes  but  they  would  not listen  either.  Not  only  did  they  take  no  notice  of  what  he  said,  but  they laughed  at  him  and  ordered  their  slaves  to  insult  him  and  pelt  him  with stones. Sadly, the Prophet (pbuh) left the city and found a quiet place near a wall  on  the  edge  of  town  where  he  could  be  alone.  There  he  prayed  to Allah  in  these  words:  “  O  Allah,  to  Thee  I  complain  of  my  weakness, helplessness  and  lowliness  before  men.  0  Most  Merciful,  Thou  art  the Lord of the weak, and Thou art my Lord. To whom wouldst Thou leave my fate? To a stranger who insults me or to an enemy to whom Thou hast      given  power  over  me?  If  Thou  art  not  angry  with  me,  I  care  not  what happens to me. Thy favor alone is my objective. I take refuge in the Light of Thy countenance by which the darkness is illumined and on which this world  and  the  other  depend,  lest  Thy  anger  descend  upon  me  or  Thy wrath  light  upon  me.  It  is  for  Thee  to  be  satisfied  until  Thou  art  well pleased.  There  is  no  power  and  no  might  save  through  Thee.”  The  wall near which the Prophet (pbuh) was sitting belonged to a garden owned by two brothers. When they heard his prayer, they were very sorry for him and sent one of their slaves to him with a dish filled with grapes. Before he  began  to  eat,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  said  'Bismillah'-'In  the  Name  of Allah.' The servant, whose name was „Addas, was very surprised at these words, which he had never heard before. 'By Allah', said „Addas, 'this is not the way the people of this country speak.' 'Then from what country do you come, 'Addas, and what is your religion?' asked the Prophet (pbuh). 'I am a Christian from the Assyrian town of Nineveh', he replied. 'From the town of that good man Jonah, son of Matta', added the Prophet 'How do you know about him?' asked „Addas. 'He is my brother-he was a Prophet and  I  am  a  Prophet',  answered  the  Messenger  of  Allah  (pbuh).  „Addas bent down and kissed the Prophet's head, his hands and his feet, because now he saw that he was truly a Prophet. The Prophet (pbuh) then walked back to Mecca. He was now able to put up with everything patiently for he knew that Allah would never leave him. His journey to Ta'if had not been  in  vain  for  „Addas,  the  Christian,  had  become  a  Muslim,  and  this was to he the beginning of great changes."

                "The Night Journey And The Ascent To Heaven": "One night as the Prophet (pbuh) lay sleeping in the same spot where 'Abd al-Muttalib  used  to  sleep,  next  to  the  Ka‟bah,  he  was  woken  by  the Archangel Gabriel. Later the Prophet (pbuh) described what happened: 'I sat up and he took hold of my arm. I stood beside him and he brought me to the door of the mosque where there was a white animal for me to ride.' The Prophet (pbuh) told of how he mounted the animal and, with the Archangel Gabriel at his side, was transported from Mecca to the mosque called  al-Aqsa,  in  far  away  Jerusalem.  There  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  found Abraham,  Moses,  and  Jesus  among  a  group  of  Prophets.  The  Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) acted as their leader, or imam, in prayer. Then he was brought two jugs, one containing wine and the other milk. He chose the milk and refused the wine. At this, the Archangel Gabriel said, 'You have been rightly guided to the fitrah, the true nature of man, and so will your people  be,  Muhammad.  Wine  is  forbidden  to  you.  The  Prophet  (pbuh) also  related  how  they  passed  through  Heaven's  gates  and  saw  countless angels.  Among  them  was  Malik,  the  Keeper  of  Hell,  who  never  smiles. Malik stepped forward and showed the Prophet (pbuh) a view of Hell and the  terrible  plight  of  those  who  suffer  in  that  place.  Then  the  Prophet (pbuh)  was  taken  up  by  the  angels,  through  the  seven  Heavens,  one  by one  Along  the  way  he  again  saw  Jesus,  Moses,  and  Abraham,  and  the Prophet (pbuh) said that he had never seen a man more like himself than Abraham.  He  also  saw  John,  called  Yahya  in  Arabic,  Joseph  or  Yusef, Enoch,  that  is  Idris,  and  Aaron.  At  last  he  reached  the  Lote  Tree  of  the Uttermost, the sidrat al-muntaha where no Prophet had been before. Here the Prophet (pbuh) received Revelation of what Muslims believe. “The Messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his Lord and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers-We make no distinction between any of His messengers-and they say: We hear, and we obey. Grant us Thy forgiveness, our Lord. Unto Thee is the homecoming”. (Qur'an 2.285) , Then he was taken into the Light of the Divine Presence of Allah, and was instructed that Muslims should pray fifty times a day. The Prophet (pbuh) recalled: “ On my way back I passed by Moses and what a good friend to you he was! He asked me how many prayers had I been  ordained  to  perform.  When  I  told  him  fifty,  he  said,  'Prayer  is  a serious matter and your people are weak, so go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce the number for you and your community.' I did so and He took away ten. Again I passed by Moses and he said the same again; and so it went on until only five prayers for the whole day and night were left.     Moses again gave me the same advice. I replied that I had been back to my Lord and asked him to reduce the number until I was ashamed, and I would not do it again. He of you who performs the five prayers faithfully, will have the reward of fifty prayers. On  the  morning  following  these  events  and  the  Prophet's  return  to Mecca, he told Quraysh what had happened. Most of them said, 'By God! This is ridiculous! A caravan takes a month to go to Syria and a month to return!  Can  you  do  that  long  journey  in  a  single  night?'  Even  many Muslims were amazed by this and wanted the Prophet (pbuh) to explain. Some ran with the news to Abu Bakr who said, 'By Allah, if Muhammad (pbuh) himself has said so, then it is true. Remember, the Prophet tells us that the word of Allah comes to him directly from heaven to earth at any hour by day or night, and we believe him. Isn't  that  a  greater  miracle  than  what  you  are  now  doubting?'  Then Abu  Bakr  went  to  the  mosque  and  listened  to  the  Prophet's  detailed description of Jerusalem. He commented, 'You tell the truth, 0 Prophet of Allah!'  From  then  on,  Abu  Bakr  was  honored  with  the  title  'al-Siddiq‟, which  means  'he  who  gives  his  word  to  support  the  truth'.  Others  also began  to  believe  the  Prophet's  story  when  he  went  on  to  describe  two caravans  he  had  seen  on  his  way  back  to  Mecca.  He  told  the  doubters where he had seen the caravans, what they were carrying and when they would arrive in Mecca. All that the Prophet (pbuh) had said was born out when the caravans arrived at the time he said they would, carrying all that he had described. “Glory  be  to  Him,  who  carried  His  servant  by  night  from  the  Holy Mosque to the Far distant place of worship, the Neighborhood which We have blessed, that We might show him some of Our signs, He, only He is the All-hearing, the All-seeing”. (Qur'an 17:1) By  the  Star  when  it  setteth,  Your  comrade  is  not  astray,  neither deceived,  Nor  does  he  speak  of  his  (own)  desire.  This  is  naught  but  a revelation revealed, Taught him by one mighty in power, very strong; he stood poised, being on the uppermost horizon, Then drew near and came down,  two  bows'-length  away,  or  nearer,  Then  revealed  to  His  servant that which He revealed. His heart lies not of what he saw; What, will you then dispute with him what he sees? Indeed, he saw him yet another time By the Lote- Tree of the utmost Boundary Near which is the Garden of Abode  When  there  covered  the  Lote-  Tree  that  which  covered;  his  eye turne not aside, nor yet was overbold. Verily, he saw one of the greatest signs of his Lord.(Qur'an 53:1-18)."

                "The Treaty of ‘Aqabah": "In Yathrib there were two main tribes, the Aws and the Khazraj.  Both  were  very  powerful,  they  were  always  at  war  with  one another,  and  both  worshipped  idols.  Also  in  Yathrib  were  many  Jews who, unlike the Arab at that time, knew that there was only One God, and worshipped  Him.  They  had  told  the  Arabs  many  times  that  a  Prophet would  be  coming  to  them.  The  time  came  for  the  pilgrimage  to  the Ka‟bah,  and  several  people  from  Yathrib  were  going,  among  them  six men  from  the  tribe  of  Khazraj.  They  had  heard  about  the  Prophet Mohammed‟s  preaching  and  thought  that  must  be  the  Prophet  the  Jews had told them about. So they decided to go speak to him during their stay in Mecca. They met the Prophet (pbuh) at a spot known as „Aqabah, near Mecca,  and  invited  them  to  sit  with  him.  He  explained  to  them  what Islam meant recited to them from the Qur'an. When they heard the Qur'an recited touched their hearts so deeply that they became Muslims and on leaving  Mecca  they  promised  to  return  the  following  year.  When  they reached Yathrib carrying Islam in their hearts, they told their relatives and friends  what  they  had  heard  from  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  many  more people became Muslims. A year passed and the pilgrimage season came around again. Twelve important  men  from  Yathrib  went  to  Mecca  to  meet  the  Prophet  (pbuh) and  promised  faithfully  to  serve  him  and  Islam.  In  return,  the  Prophet (pbuh) sent one of his friends, Mus‟ab ibn 'Umayr, with them to teach the Qur'an and instruct them in their new religion. Another year passed and still  more  Muslims  came  from  Yathrib  to Mecca  for  the pilgrimage.  On this occasion a secret meeting with the Prophet (pbuh) was arranged to be held at night. Seventy-three men and one woman from Yathrib came, and the Prophet (pbuh) arrived with his uncle, al-„Abbas. During this meeting the  men  from  Yathrib  offered  to  protect  and  defend  the  Prophet  (pbuh) and his followers if they would come to live in Yathrib. This promise of protection came to be known as the Treaty of „Aqabah. The treaty was most fortunate for even though Islam was growing in Yathrib,  the  Muslims  in  Mecca  were  still  suffering.  The  Prophet  (pbuh) therefore told his friends and followers to go to Yathrib where they would be safe, and most of them took this opportunity to leave. Despite all this suffering  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  was  not  allowed  to  fight  his  enemies,  for Allah had told him to forgive those who insulted him or would not listen to his message. But the Quraysh had closed their minds so utterly to the word of Allah, and grew so hard-hearted towards the Prophet (pbuh)and his  followers,  that  Allah  gave  permission  to  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  to  fight those who tried to harm him or his companions.     “Permission  is  given  unto  those  who  fight  because  they  have  been wronged; And Allah is surely able to give them victory; Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said: Our Lord is Allah”.(Qur'an 22.39-40) Quraysh began to fear the Prophet (pbuh) for they realised that he was now  strong  enough  to  fight  them  and  had  been  given  leave  to  do  so  by Allah. They also knew that he now had the people of Yathrib to help and protect him. Seeing that the Muslims were leaving the city, they decided to kill the Prophet (pbuh), before he, too, left Mecca to join his followers in Yathrib. In this way they hoped to put an end to Islam once and for all."

                "Al-Hijrah": "The Breaking of All Connections with One's Home, for the Sake of Allah Alone.  After  his  companions  had  left  for  Yathrib,  the  Prophet  (pbuh) stayed in Mecca, waiting for permission from Allah to leave the city. Abu Bakr  and  Ali  stayed  with  him.  There  were  also  some  Muslims  whom Quraysh  had  not  allowed  to  leave.  Abu  Bakr  kept  asking  the  Prophet (pbuh) to allow him to go to Yathrib, but the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) kept saying, 'Do not be in a hurry; it might be that Allah will give you a travelling companion.' The leaders of Quraysh assembled in the house of their  ancestor,  Qusayy,  as  was  customary  when  they  had  an  important decision  to  make.  They  had  to  find  a  way  of  getting  rid  of  the  Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), before he was able to join his friends in Yathrib. As they were busy arguing, the Devil appeared at the door in the form of a noble  and  handsome  old  man.  When  they  saw  this  elderly  gentleman standing there, they asked him who he was. He said he was a Shaikh from the  mountains  who  had  heard  what  they  meant  to  do  and  thought  he might be able to help or advise them. They thought he looked like a wise man, so they invited him in. Each  leader  then  started  to  put  forward  ideas  about  what  should  be done, but none of them could agree about which was best, until AbuJahl told  them  his  plan.  This  was  that  each  clan  should  provide  a  strong, young  warrior,  each  of  whom  would  be  given  a  sword.  All  the  young warriors would then wait outside the Prophet's house and together attack him as he came out. In this way they would be rid of him but as the blame for killing him would fall on all the clans, the Prophet's family would not be able to seek revenge. When  he  heard  this,  the  Devil  in  the  disguise  of  the  old  man,  said, 'That man is right; in my opinion it is the only thing to do!' The leaders of Quraysh then left to carry out their plan to murder the Prophet (pbuh). “And when the unbelievers plot against thee, to confine thee, or kill thee,  or  to  drive  thee  out,  they  were  plotting,  But  Allah  was  (also) plotting; and Allah is the best of plotters”. (Qur'an 8.30) Before  the  night  fell,  on  which  Muhammad  (pbuh)  was  to  be  killed, the Archangel Gabriel came to him and said, 'Do not sleep tonight in your own bed.' The Prophet (pbuh) understood what was going to happen, so he  told  „Ali  to  lie  in  his  bed  and  wrap  himself  in  the  blanket  that  the Prophet  (pbuh)  normally  used,  promising  that  no  harm  would  befall him.With the coming of darkness the young men of Quraysh had gathered outside  the  Prophet's  house,  waiting  for  him  to  come  out.  After  he  had     made  sure  that  'Ali  was  safe,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  left  the  house.  At  that very moment Allah took away the sight of the warriors so that they could not  see  the  Prophet  (pbuh),  who  took  a  handful  of  dust,  sprinkled  it  on their heads and recited these verses: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “Ya Sin By the Wise Qur'an, Thou art truly among those sent On the straight  path;  A  Revelation  of  the  All-mighty,  the  All-wise,  That  thou may  warn  a  people  whose  fathers  were  never  warned,  so  they  are heedless. The Word has already proved true of most of them, yet they do not believe. Lo! We have put on their necks collars of iron up to the chin, so  that  they  are  made  stiff-necked.  and  We  have  put  before  them  a barrier; and We have covered them so they do not see”.(Qur'an 36.1-9) The young men waited the whole night and were furious when, in the morning, they saw „Ali instead of the Prophet (pbuh) coming out of the house.  I  They  realised  that  their  plan  had  failed  completely.  In  the meantime,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  went  to  Abu  Bakr's  house  and  told  him, 'Allah has told me that now is the time for us to leave Mecca.' 'Together?' asked  Abu  Bakr.  'Together',  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  replied.  Abu  Bakr  wept for joy, because now he knew that the travelling companion he had been promised was the Prophet (pbuh) himself. Then he said,'O Messenger of Allah, these are the two camels which I have  kept  ready  for  this.'  And  so,  the  two  of  them  left  for  a  cave  in Thawr, a mountain to the south of Mecca where they intended to hide. When  they  were  out  of  the  city  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  looked  back  and said, 'Of all Allah's earth, you are the dearest place to Allah and to me and if my people had not driven me out I would never have left you.' When Quraysh found out that the Prophet (pbuh) and his companion had gone, they set out after them, searching in every direction. Three days later  they  finally  reached  the  cave  where  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  Abu Bakr  were  hiding,  but  a  strange  and  wonderful  thing  had  happened.  A spider had woven its web right across the entrance to the cave and a dove was nesting with her mate nearby. As the Meccans stood in front of the cave, with only the spider's web separating them from the fugitives, Abu Bakr began to fear for their safety. He whispered to the Prophet (pbuh), they  are  very  close.  If  one  of  them  turns  we  will  be  seen.'  But  he  was comforted  by  the Prophet's  reply:  “What do  you  think of  two  who  have with them Allah as their third? 'Grieve not, for verily Allah is with us”. (Qur'an 9.40) . After a few moments the search parry decided that no one    could have entered the cave recently, or the spider's web would not have been complete and the dove would not have nested there, and so they left without  searching  inside.  Three  days  later  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  Abu Bakr  thought  it  safe  to  leave  the  cave.  Abu  Bakr's  son,  'Amir,  had arranged for three camels and a guide to help them continue their journey to  Yathrib.  'Amir  would  ride  behind  his  father.  The  leaders  of  Quraysh, meanwhile,  returned  to  Mecca  and  offered  a  reward  of  one  hundred camels to whoever captured the Prophet (pbuh). Among those who went in search of him was a famous warrior. He was, in fact, the only one to catch up with him, but whenever he came close, his horse would suddenly sink up to its knees in the sand. When this had happened three times, he understood  that  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  was  protected  by  a  power  stronger than anything he had known, and so he went back to Mecca. On arriving there he warned everyone against continuing the search, relating what had happened to him. “If you do not help him, still Allah has helped him already, When the unbelievers drove him forth, (he second of two, When the two were in the Cave, when  he  said  to  his  companion, \"Grieve  not;  surely  Allah  is  with us.\" Then Allah caused His peace and Reassurance to descend upon him, And helped him with hosts you cannot see, And He made the word of the unbelievers the lowest; While Allah's word is the uppermost; Allah is All- mighty, All-wise”. (Qur'an 9.40) The Prophet's journey from Mecca is called the hijrah, or migration. It was really the first step towards the spread of Islam throughout the entire world, and Muslims begin their calendar from the year of the hijrah."

                "Arrival In Yathrib": "When the people of Yathrib heard that the Prophet (pbuh) had left Mecca and was on his way to their city, they anxiously awaited his arrival. Each morning they would go to the edge of the city to see if he were coming. Finally,  on  Monday,  September  27,  in  the  year  622  A.D.,  someone  saw him in the distance and shouted to everyone, 'Here is Muhammad! (pbuh) the  Messenger  of  Allah  has  arrived!'  All  the  Muslims  went  out  to  greet him,  shouting,  “Allahu  Akbar”!  Allah  is  Great!  Muhammad  the Messenger of Allah has arrived!' The women and children sang songs to show how glad they were to see him. The Prophet (pbuh) entered the city with  his  friend  Abu  Bakr.  Most  of  The  people  there  had  not  seen  him before and as they gathered around they did not know which of the two was  the  Prophet  (pbuh),  until  Abu  Bakr  got  up  to  shield  him  with  his cloak  from  the  burning  sun.  Yathrib  would  now  be  Called  al-Medina, which means, The City. The Messenger of God (pbuh) stayed in Quba', which is a place at the entrance of Medina, for three days. On the first Friday after his arrival the Prophet led the congregation in prayer. After this many of the wealthiest men invited him to come and live with them and share their riches. But he refused and, pointing to his she-camel, Qaswa', said, 'Let her go her way', because he knew that his camel was under Allah's command and would guide him to the spot where he should stay. They let the camel go until she finally knelt down beside a house belonging to the Bani an-Najjar, the tribe to whom the Prophet's mother was related. This house was used as a drying-place  for  dates  and  belonged  to  two  young  orphan  boys  named Sahl  and  Suhayl.  They  offered  to  give  it  to  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  but  he insisted  on  paying  them  for  it,  and  so  their  guardian,  As‟ad  the  son  of Zurarah, who was present, made the necessary arrangements. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered that a mosque and a place for him to live be built on the site. All the Muslims worked together to finish it quickly- even  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  joined  in.  It  was  here  that  the  Muslims  would pray and meet to make important decisions and plans. The building was quite plain and simple. The floor was beaten earth and the roof of palm leaves  was  held  up  by  tree  trunks.  Two  Stones  marked  the  direction  of prayer. At first worshippers faced Jerusalem, but Soon after the direction of prayer was changed towards the Ka‟bah in Mecca. After  the  building  of  the  mosque,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  wanted  to strengthen  the  relationship  between  the  people  called  the  Muhajirah  or Emigrants, who had left Mecca with him, and the people of Medina, who     were  known  as  the  Ansar,  or  Helpers.  Each  man  from  Medinah  took  as his brother a man from Mecca,  sharing everything with him and treating him  as  a  member  of  his  own  family.  This  was  the  beginning  of  the Islamic brotherhood. In the early days of Islam, the times for prayer were not announced and So the Muslims would come to the mosque and wait for the prayer so as not to miss it. The Prophet (pbuh) wondered how to tell  the  people  that  it  was  time  for  prayers.  He  discussed  it  with  his friends, and at first two ideas were put forward; that of blowing a horn as the Jews did, and that of using a wooden clapper like the Christians. Then a man called „Abd Allah ibn Zayd came to the Prophet (pbuh) and told him he had had a dream in which he had seen a man dressed all in green, holding a wooden clapper. He had said to the man, 'Would you sell me your clapper in order to call the people to prayer?' The man had replied,  'A  better  way  to  call  the  people  to  prayer  is  to  Say:  \"Allahu Akbar, Allah is Most Great!\" four times, followed by \"I bear witness that there  is  no  divinity  but  Allah,  I  bear  witness  that  Muhammad  is  the Messenger of Allah, Come to prayer, come to prayer, Come to salvation, come to salvation. Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar! There is no divinity but Allah!\"' When the Prophet (pbuh) heard this, he said it was a true vision from Allah.  He  sent  for  Bilal, who  had  a beautiful, strong  voice,  and  ordered him  to  call  the  people  to  prayer  in  just  this  way.  Bilal  did  so  and  soon after 'Umar came out of his house and told the Prophet (pbuh) that he had seen exactly the same vision himself. The Prophet (pbuh) replied, 'Allah be praised for that.' The adhan, or call to prayer, which came to 'Abd Allah ibn Zayd in his dream and was performed by Bilal on the instruction of the Prophet (pbuh), is the one we still  hear  today  being  called  from  the  minarets  of  mosques  all  over  the world."

                "The Battle Of Badr": "The  Muslims  who  had  gone  to  Medinah,  had  left  all  their  belongings behind in Mecca and these had been taken by their enemies. Thus, when the Muslims heard that Abu Sufyan, one of the leaders of Quraysh, was on his way back to Mecca from Syria with a large caravan of goods, they decided that the time had come for them to retrieve some of their losses. The  Prophet  (pbuh)  gave  the  Muslims  permission  for  this  attack  and everyone began to get ready for the raid, for it had been revealed: “Permission to fight is given unto those who fight because they have been  wronged;  and  Allah  is  surely  able  to  give  them  victory”  (Qur'an .) “The Revelation had mentioned that a thing most serious with Allah was to turn (men) from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Holy Mosque, and to drive his people from there…for persecution is worse than killing”. (Qur'an 2.217) The  retrieval  of  their  goods,  however,  was  not  their  only  reason  for wanting  to  attack  the  caravan.  The  Muslims  did  not  think  they  should simply remain safely in Medinah; they wanted to spread the message of Islam.  They thus felt that if Quraysh wanted freedom to trade in safety, then the Muslims must also have freedom to believe in Allah, to follow His  Messenger  (pbuh),  and  spread  His  Word.  It  was,  therefore,  thought that  the  best,  and  only  way  to  get  Quraysh  to  understand  this  was  to attack what was most important to them-a caravan. Abu  Sufyan,  in  the  meantime,  heard  about  the  Muslims'  plan  and quickly  sent  a  message  to  Quraysh  in  Mecca,  telling  them  that  the caravan was in danger and asking for help. As a result nearly all Quraysh came out to help him defend the caravan. There were a thousand men and two  hundred  horses.  The  women  also  went  along  to  cheer  the  men  on with  their  singing.  Unaware  of  this,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  set  out  with  his followers. It was the month of Ramadan and the Muslims were fasting. There were only three hundred and five of them, most of them Ansar, men from Medinah. With them they had three horses and seventy camels, on which they rode in turns. They arrived in the area of Badr, some distance from Medinah where they made camp and waited for news of the caravan. Then they heard that Quraysh  had  set  out  from  Mecca  with  a  strong  army.  The  situation  had suddenly  changed.  They  were  no  longer  going  to  make  a  raid  on  a     caravan-they  were  going  to  have  to  fight  Quraysh.  The  Prophet  (pbuh) gathered  his  men  around  him  to  find  out  what  they  wanted  to  do.  First Abu  Bakr,  and  then  „Umar,  spoke for  the  Muslims  who  had  come  from Mecca.  They  said  they  would  obey  the Prophet  (pbuh).  But the  Prophet (pbuh) wanted to hear the opinion of the Ansar, because he did not want to  force  them  into  doing  something  they  did  not  want  to  do.  Sa‟d  Ibn Mu‟adh, one of the leaders of the Ansar, got up and said, we believe in you and we swear before all men that what you have brought is the truth. We have given you our word and agreement to hear and obey. So go where you wish, we are with you even if you should lead us into the sea! The Prophet (pbuh) was greatly encouraged by these words and so it was  agreed  to  fight.  Abu  Sufyan  learned  where  the  Muslims  were camped. He changed the course of the caravan and quickly took it out of their  reach.  He  then  sent  word  to  Quraysh  telling  them  that  the  caravan was safe and that they should return to Mecca. But the leaders of Quraysh were proud and stubborn men. They refused to return as they had made up their minds to show everyone how powerful they were by destroying the Muslims.Now there was a wadi, or valley, at Badr, with wells on the side  nearest  Medina,  and  it  was  here  that  the  Muslims  took  up  position facing the valley with the wells behind them. Quraysh meanwhile placed themselves on the other side of the valley. The  Muslims  then  dug  a  reservoir,  filled  it  with  water  from  one  of  the wells,  and  made  a  barrier  around  it.  Then  they  stopped  up  the  wells.  In this  way  the  Muslims  had  enough  drinking  water  for  themselves,  while the  Meccans  would  have  to  cross  the  valley  and  fight  the  Muslims  in order  to  get  water.  The  night  before  the  battle,  while  the  Muslims  slept peacefully, a heavy rain fell. “When  He  made  the  slumber  fall  upon  you  as  a  reassurance  from Him and sent down water from the sky upon you, in order that He might purify you, and remove from you the fear of Satan, and strengthen your hearts and make firm (your) fret thereby”. (Qur'an 8.11) On the morning of  Friday,  the  17th  of  Ramadan,  2  A.H.,  (March  17th,  AD),  the  two armies  advanced  and  drew  closer  to  one  another.  The  rain  been  heavier on the side of Quraysh, making the ground soft and difficult. On the side of  the  Muslims,  however,  the  rain  had  backed  the  sand  down  hard, making it easy for them to march. The Prophet (pbuh) preferred the men to  fight  in  ranks.  As  they  prepared  to  march  he  noticed  someone  had stepped out in front of the others.    The  Prophet  (pbuh)prodded  him  in  the  side  with  an  arrow,  saying, 'Stand  in  line!'  The  man,  Sawad,  exclaimed,  'You  have  hurt  me,  O Messenger  of  Allah!  Allah  has  sent  you  to  be  just  and  good.'  Prophet (pbuh)  lifted  his  shirt  and  said,  'Then  do  the  same  to  me.  The  man approached  and  kissed  him  on  the spot  instead,  saying, '0  Messenger  of Allah, you see what is before us and I may not survive the battle. If this is my last time with you, I want the last thing I do in life to be this.'Shortly after  he  went  into  battle,  Sawad  died  a  martyr.  Having  examined  the ranks, the Prophet (pbuh) then went to a shelter made of palm branches from  which  he  could  command  the  battle.  Abu  Bakr  stayed  with  him, while Sa‟d ibn Mu'adh, with several of the Ansar, stood outside guarding the  hut.  When  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  saw  the  enormous  Quraysh  army descending  the  hill  into  the  valley,  with  all  their  banners  and  drums,  he began  to  pray  for  the  help  which  Allah  had  promised  him.  These  were some of his words. '0 Allah, here come Quraysh full of vanity and pride, who  oppose  Thee  and  call  Thy  Messenger  a  liar.  O  Allah,  if  this  little band (the Muslims) perishes today, there will be none left in the land to worship Thee.' “When ye sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): I will  help  you  with  a  thousand  of  the  angels,  rank  on  rank.  Allah appointed it only as good tidings, and that your hearts might thereby be at ease.  Victory  cometh  only  by  the  help  of  Allah.  Lo!  Allah  is  Mighty, Wise”. (Qur'an 8. 9-10) At first the battle began in single combat when one of Quraysh swore that  he  would  drink  from  the  Muslims'  reservoir  and  then  destroy  it,  or die in the attempt. Hamzah, the Prophet's uncle, came forward to face him and killed him. Three of the most important men of Quraysh then stepped forward and gave out a challenge for single combat. The Prophet (pbuh) sent out 'Ali, Hamzah, and „Ubaydah ibn al-Harith, to face them. It was not long before Hamzah and „Ali had killed their opponents. As  for  'Ubaydah,  he  had  wounded  his  enemy  but  was  wounded himself,  and  so  his  two  companions  killed  the  wounded  Meccan  and carried  'Ubaydah  back  to  the safety  of  the  Muslim  ranks.  After  this,  the two armies attacked each other and fighting broke out all around. The sky was  filled  with  arrows.  The  Muslim  army  held  its  ground  against  the great army of Quraysh and even though the Muslims were much fewer in number,  they  gained  a  great  victory,  destroying  the  Meccan  army  and killing  most  of  its  leaders.  Among  the  leading  Meccans  who  died  were Abu Jahl and Umayyah ibn Khalaf, who was killed by his former slave, Bilal.  Seeing  that  their  leaders  were  nearly  all  dead,  the  remainder  of Quraysh retreated. The Prophet (pbuh) sent word to Medinahto tell them   of  the  victory.  He  then  gathered  up  the  spoils  of  war  and  divided  them equally  among  the  Muslims.  Some  of  the  Meccans  had  been  taken prisoner  and  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  gave  orders  that  they  should  be  treated well until their relatives from among Quraysh came to fetch them. “Ye  (Muslims)  did  not  slay  them,  but  Allah  slew  them  and  thou (Muhammad)  threwest  not  when  thou  didst  throw,  but  Allah  threw,  so that He might test the believers by a fair test from Him. Lo! Allah is All- hearing, All-Knowing”. (Qur'an 8.17)."

                "Uhud-Defeat Comes From Disobedience": "When the survivors of the defeated Quraysh at Badr to Mecca gathered to speak with Abu Sufyan. They said, 'Muhammad has best men, so help us to fight him so that we may avenge those we have lost.' In order to do this  it  was  agreed  that  everyone  who  had  had  a  share  in  the  caravan should  put  his  profits  towards  the  cost  of  a  new  army,  which  would  be three times as big as the one at Badr. Among those who joined the new army  was  an  Abyssinian  slave  called  Wahshi;  who  was  known  for  his accuracy  with  the  spear.  His  master,  Jubayr  ibn  al-Mut‟im,  said  to  him, 'Go  with  the  army  and  if  you  kill  Hamzah,  the  uncle  of  Muhammad,  in revenge for my uncle's death, I will set you free when Hind, Abu Sufyan's wife, heard about this she sent a Wahshi to say that she would clothe him in  gold  and  silk  if  he  would  carry  out  his  master's  wish,  for  she,  too, wanted Hamzah dead because he had both her father and brother. While the Meccans made their plans, the Prophet's uncle, „Abbas, one the  few  Muslims  still  living  in  Mecca,  sent  a  letter  of  warning  to  the Prophet  (pbuh)  in  Medina.  He  told  him  that  Quraysh  were  setting  out with a huge arm for Uhud, a place just outside Medina. On receiving this timely warning the Prophet (pbuh) gathered his companions around him to discuss what they should do. He thought it would be better to wait for the enemy inside city rather than go out to meet them, because it would be  easier  to  defend  Medinahfrom  inside  the  city  walls.  But  the  young Muslims  were go out and face Quraysh. They said, '0 Prophet of Allah, lead  us  out  against  our  enemies,  or  else  they  will  think  we  are  too cowardly and too weak to fight them.' One of the rulers of Medina, „Abd Allah  ibn  Ubayy,  however,  agreed  with  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  advised him to remain in the city, saying, 'Whenever we have gone out to fight an enemy we have met with disaster, but none has ever come in against us without being defeated.' But  when  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  saw  that  the  majority  were  in  favor  of going  out  to  meet  Quraysh,  he  decided  to  do  so,  and  after  the  Friday prayer he put on his armor. The  Muslims  then  set  out  with  one  thousand  men  in  the  direction  of Mount  Uhud  which  overlooks  Medina.  The  enemy  was  camped  on  the plain below the mountain where they were laying waste the crops of the Muslims.'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy was angry that the Prophet (pbuh) had not followed  his  advice  and  after  going  part  of  the  way,  turned  back  for Medina,  taking  one  third  of  the  entire  army  with  him.  This  left  the      Prophet  (pbuh)  with  only  seven  hundred  men  to  meet  the  enormous Meccan army, which numbered three thousand. The  remainder  of  the  Mus1ims  went  on  until  they  reached  the mountain  of  Uhud.  There  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  ordered  them  to  stand  in ranks  in  front  of  the  mountain,  so  that  they  would  be  protected  from behind.  He  then  positioned  fifty  archers  on  top  of  the  mountain,  giving them the following order: 'Keep the Meccan cavalry away from us  with your arrows and don't let them come against us from the rear, whether the battle  goes  in  our  favor  or  against  us.  Whatever  happens  keep  to  your places so that we cannot be attacked from your direction, even if you see us being slain or booty being taken.' When the Muslims were in position, the Prophet (pbuh) held up his sword and said, 'Who will use this sword with its right?' This was a great honor and many men rose to claim it, but the Prophet (pbuh) decided to give it to Abu Dujanah, a fearless warrior. Then  the  battle  commenced.  The  Muslims  were  well  organized  and  had the  advantage,  because  although  Quraysh  had  more  than  four  times  as many men, they were tired from their journey and thus not ready to fight. As a result, the Muslims were able to make a surprise attack, led by Abu Dujanah,  who  was  wearing  a  brilliant  red  turban.  As  the  fighting increased the Quraysh women, led by Hind, began to beat their drums to urge  their  men  on.  They  called  out  poems  to  encourage their  men  to  be brave. 'If you advance, we hug you, spread soft rugs beneath you; if you retreat, we leave you. Leave and no more love you.' Abu Dujanah said: 'I saw someone urging the enemy on, shouting wildly, and I made for him, but when I lifted my sword against him he screamed and I saw that it was a woman; I respected the Apostle's sword too much to  use  it  on  a  woman.'  That  woman  was  Hind.  As  usual,  Hamzah,  the Prophet's uncle, fought with great courage, but while leading the Muslims in  a  fierce  attack,  which  nearly  defeated  the  Meccans,  he  was  suddenly and cruelly struck down by the slave Wahshi. Later, Wahshi told how it happened:  'I  was  watching  Hamzah  while  he  was  killing  men  with  his sword. I... aimed my spear until I was sure it would the mark and hurled it at  him.  He  came  on  towards  me  but  collapsed  and  fell.  I  left  him  there until he died, then I came and took back my spear. Then I went back to the camp because I did not want to kill anyone but him. My only aim in killing him was to gain my freedom.' The  Quraysh  warriors  were  soon  scattered  and  forced  to  retreat.  It looked  as  though  they  had  been  defeated!  Seeing  this,  forty  of  the  fifty Muslims archers on top of the mountain ran down from their position to collect  booty,  for  the  Quraysh  army  had  left  many  of  their  belongings behind.  The  archers  rushed  to  take  what  they  could,  forgetting  the   Prophet's  orders.  Khalid  Ibn  al-Walid,  Commander  of  the  Quraysh cavalry,  saw  what'  happening  and  quickly  turned  his  men  around  and ordered  them  to  attack  the  Muslims  from  behind.  The  Muslims  were taken  completely  by  surprise.  The  Quraysh  then  began  attacking  from both  sides  at  once.  Many  Muslims  were  killed  and  instead  of  winning they began to lose the battle. To add to the confusion, it was rumored that the Prophet (pbuh) had killed. When the Muslims heard this they were at a loss to know what to do. Then a man named Anas called out, 'Brothers! If Muhammad (pbuh) has  been  killed  what  will  your  lives  be  worth  without  him?  Don't  think about  living  or  dying.  Fight  for  Allah.  Get  up  and  die  the  way Muhammad (pbuh) died!‟ and on hearing these words the Muslims took courage. There  had  been  several  cavalry  attacks  on  the  position  held  by  the Prophet  (pbuh)  and  his  companions  and  the  Prophet's  cheek  had  been badly  gashed.  As  the  Meccans  closed  in  again  he  called  out,  'Who  will sell his life for us?' At this, five Ansar got up and fought until they were killed, one by one. Their places were soon taken, however, by a number of Muslims who drove  off  the  attackers.  Amongst  the  defending  Muslims  was  Abu Dujanah who put his arms around the Prophet (pbuh) and made himself into a human shield. Throughout the remainder of the battle he held on to the Prophet (pbuh), but as the fighting drew to a close he suddenly let go. Abu  Dujanah  was  dead,  killed  by  the  many  arrows  in  his  back  that  had been  aimed  at  the  Prophet  (pbuh).  With  the  defeat  of  the  Muslims, Quraysh were at last avenged. As they left the field of battle Abu Sufyan called out to his men, 'You have done well; victory in war goes by turns- today in exchange for Badr!'  When he heard this, the Prophet (pbuh) told „Umar to answer him, saying, 'Allah is Most High and Most Glorious. We are  not  equal.  Our  dead  are  in  Paradise  and  your  dead  are  in  Hell!'  The Muslim soldiers then followed the departing Quraysh part of the way to make sure they were not going to attack Medinah. After the enemy had left, the Prophet (pbuh) made his way around the Battle-field  to  see  the  extent  of  the  Muslim  losses.  Many  of  the  most faithful  Muslims  had  been  killed.  Among  the  dead,  the  Prophet  (pbuh) found  the  body  of  his  closest  friend  and  uncle,  Hamzah,  who  had  been killed by the slave, Wahshi. At the sight of this, the Prophet (pbuh) said, 'There  will  never  be  a  moment  as  sad  for  me  as  this.'  Hamzah's  sister, Safiyya,  came  to  pray  and  ask  forgiveness  for  her  brother,  saying  'We belong to Allah and to Allah we are returning.' After the Prophet (pbuh)   had prayed over the many dead, he said, 'I tell you that no one has been wounded in Allah's cause but Allah will remember him and on the Day of Resurrection  will  raise  him  from  the  dead.  Look  for  the  one  who  has learned most of the Qur'an and put him in front of his companions in the grave.' They were buried where they had fallen as martyrs. Of them Allah says: “Do not think that those, who were killed for Allah's sake are dead. Nay,  they  are  alive.  With  their  Lord  they  have  provision.  Jubilant  (are they)  because  of  that  which  Allah  hath  bestowed  upon  them  of  His bounty,  rejoicing  for  the  sake  of  those  that  have  not  yet  joined  them because they have nothing to fear or grieve over”.(Qur'an 3.169-170) It is said that the Prophet (pbuh) swore that no Muslim who had died for his beliefs would want to come back to life for a single hour, even if he could own the whole world, unless he could return and fight for Allah and  be  killed  a  second  time.  The  Muslims  realised  that  their  defeat  had been caused by their disobedience to the Prophet (pbuh). The Qur'an tells us that the Muslims had been tested by Allah at Uhud and had failed but that Allah forgave them their weakness. “Some of you there are that desire this world, and some of you there are  that  desire  the  next  world.  Then  He  turned  you  from  them,  that  He might  try  you;  and  He  has  forgiven  you;  and  Allah  is  bounteous  to  the believers”.    (Qur'an 3.145) People living nowadays should learn from the lessons learned by the early Muslims at Uhud. Disobedience to the Prophet (pbuh) and love for the things of this world caused their defeat. The same can happen to us as well.  Even  if  we  have  no  battle  like  Uhud  to  fight,  we  can  still  die  for Allah's  sake  by  fighting  what  is  bad  in  ourselves.  When  the  Prophet (pbuh)  came  back  from  a  battle  he  said  to  his  men,  'We  have  returned from the lesser war to the greater war.' He meant by this that the struggle that goes on within every human being to become a better person is the more difficult battle."

                "The Battle Of The Trench": "When  the  Prophet  (Pbuh)  first  arrived  in  Medinah,  the  Jews  who  were living  there  had  welcomed  him.  The  Prophet  (Pbuh)  had  returned  their greeting, as he wished to be on good terms with them. An agreement was also reached between the Muslims and the Jews, which gave the Jews the freedom to practice their religion and which also set out their rights and their  duties.  Among  these  duties  was  that  in  the  case  of  war  with Quraysh, the Jews would fight on the side of the Muslims. Despite  this  agreement,  however,  some  of  the  Jewish  tribes,  who resented the Prophet's presence in Medinah, soon began to cause trouble amongst  the  Muslims.  They  tried  to  set  the  Muslim  Emigrants  from Mecca  and  the  Ansar  against  each  other.  The  troublemakers  were  given many  warnings  but  they  continued  to  be  a  nuisance.  In  the  end,  the Muslims  had  no  choice  but  to  drive  them  from  Medinah.  A  new agreement was offered those Jews who remained but the trouble did not end there. One of the Jewish tribes, the Bani Nadir plotted to murder the Prophet (Pbuh) but their plan was discovered and they, too, were exiled from  the  city.  Knowing  that  they  could  not  defeat  the  Muslims themselves, some of the leaders of the exiled Jews secretly went to Mecca to enlist the help of Quraysh. Knowing what the Meccans would like to hear,  they  pretended  to  believe  in  the  same  things.  They  said  that  they thought  that  the  old  Arab  tradition  was  better  than  the  teachings  of  the Prophet  Muhammad  (Pbuh)  and  that  they  believed  that  the  Quraysh religion  of  worshipping  many  idols  was  better  than  the  Prophet's  with only one God. Then the Jews told them that if all the Arab tribes attacked Medinah, the Jews inside the city would help to defeat the Prophet (Pbuh) and Islam once and for all. The  leaders  of  Quraysh  were  pleased  to  hear  all  this  and  seizing  on what  seemed  to  them  a  very  good  opportunity,  agreed  to  the  plan  and began to gather together a formidable army. In the meantime in Medinah, only  one  Jewish  tribe,  the  Bani  Quraydhah,  refused  to  betray  the Muslims. Eventually  the  Muslims  learned  of  the  preparations  being  made  for war in  Mecca  and  of  the plotting  of  the Jews  within  Medinahitself. The betrayal of the Muslims by the Jews did not surprise the Prophet (Pbuh), who  said  of  them:  'The  hearts  of  the  Jews  have  become  closed  to  the truth. They have forgotten what Muses taught them long ago that there is only one God.'      “The likeness of those who are entrusted with the Law of Moses, yet apply  it  not,  is  as  the  likeness  of  the  ass  carrying  books.  Evil  is  the likeness  of  the  people  who  deny  the  revelations  of  Allah.  And  Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk”. (Qur'an 62.5) The Muslims wondered how they could defend Medinah. They heard that  Abu  Sufyan  was  coming  to  attack  them  with  an  enormous  army which  included  many  other  Arab  tribes,  as  well  as  Quraysh. What  were they  to  do  with  only  a  single  week  to  prepare?  The  Prophet  (Pbuh)  and his men knew that it would be impossible for them to fight off all these tribes! The only thing they could do was to stay inside the city and try to defend  it  as  best  they  could.  Now  among  the  people  of  Medinah  was  a Persian named Salman, who had to live in the city some time before the Prophet's  arrival  there.  As  a  convert  to  Christianity  he  had  traveled  to Medinah after Christian sages had told him that a Prophet would be born in  Arabia.  On  arriving  in  he  was,  however,  sold  into  slavery  by  the merchants with whom he had traveled. Later he became a Muslim, gained his freedom and became a member of the Prophet's household. When  the  people  gathered  to  discuss  a  plan  of  action  against  the approaching  enemy,  Salman  was  present  and  it  was  he  who  suggested that they should dig a trench around the city. The Prophet (Pbuh) thought this  a  good  idea,  so  the  Muslims  set  to  work,  although  it  was  in  the middle  of  winter.  They  worked  day  and  night,  digging  the  trench  as quickly as possible. The Prophet (Pbuh) himself carried rocks and when the  men  were  tired  he  gave  them  the  will  to  carry  on.  Someone  later recalled  how  beautiful  he  looked,  dressed  in  a red cloak  with  dust upon his breast and his dark hair nearly reaching his shoulders. There was little food at this time and the men were often hungry as they worked. On one occasion, however, a little girl gave some dates to the Prophet (Pbuh), which he spread out on a cloth. The men were then called to eat and  the  dates  kept  increasing  in  number  until  everyone  had  been  fed. Even after everyone had eaten their fill, the dates continued to increase so that  there  were  more  than  the  cloth  could  hold.  Similarly,  there  is  the story of the lamb, that has come down to us from one who was there: 'We worked  with  the  Apostle  at  the  trench.  I  had  a  half-grown  lamb  and  I thought it would be a good thing to cook it for Allah's Messenger. I told my  wife  to  grind  barley  and  make  some  bread  for  us.  I  killed  the  lamb and  we  roasted  it  for  the  Prophet  (Pbuh).  When  night  fell  and  he  was about to leave the trench, I told him we had prepared bread and meat and invited him to our home. I wanted him to come on his own, but when I said  this  he  sent  someone  to  call  all  the  men  to  come  along.  Everyone arrived and the food was served. He blessed it and invoked the Name of   Allah over it. Then he ate and so did all of the others. As soon as one lot were satisfied, another group came until all the diggers had eaten enough, but still there was food to spare. On  March  24,  627  A.D,  Abu  Sufyan  arrived  with  more  than  ten thousand men. The Muslims numbered only three thousand. Quraysh and their allies surrounded Medinah but between the two armies was the long, wide trench. The Prophet (pbuh) and his men stayed behind this trench for nearly a month defending the city against their more powerful enemy. Many times warriors  tried  to  cross  the  trench  and  enter  the  city,  but  each  time  they were pushed back by the Muslims. The Muslims  were  afraid that if any did manage to cross over, the Jews inside Medinah would join forces with them  and  the  Muslims  would  be  beaten.  The  Jewish  tribe  of  Bani Quraydhah,  who  had  stood  by  the,  agreement  with  the  Muslims,  were pressed  by  a  Jewish  emissary  from  the  enemy  without,  to  break  their promise.  Eventually  they  agreed  to  do  so  and  when  the  news  of  this reached  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  his  companions  they  were  greatly troubled. Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, the leader of the tribe of Aws, was sent by the Prophet  (pbuh)  with  two  other  men  to  find  out  if  this  were  true.  When they arrived in the part of Medinah where the Jews lived, they found were even worse than they had previously thought. Sa'd  ibn  Mu'adh,  whose  tribe  was  closely  allied  with  the  Bani Quraydhah, tried to persuade their leader not to break the treaty with the Muslims, but he refused to listen. This meant that the Muslims could not relax their guard for one moment, for they were now threatened not only by  the  enemy  beyond  the  trench,  but  by  the  Bani  Qurayzah,  within  the walls of the city. Things  became  more  difficult  for  the  Muslims  day  by  day.  It  was extremely  cold  and  food  began  to  run  out.  To  make  matters  worse,  the Bani  Qurayzah  began  openly  and  actively  to  join  forces  with  the  other Jews and cut off all supplies to the Muslims, including food. The enemies of Islam then planned how to capture Medinah. The situation looked desperate and the Prophet (pbuh) prayed to Allah to  Allah  to  help  the  Muslims  defeat  their  enemies.  That  very  night  a sandstorm  blew  up  which  buried  the  tents  of  Quraysh.  The  storm continued  for  three  days  and  three  nights  making  it  impossible  for  the enemy to light a fire to cook a meal or warm themselves by.    On one of these dark nights the Prophet (pbuh) asked one of his men, Hudhayfah  Ibn  al-Yaman,  to  go  on  a  dangerous  mission.  The  Prophet (pbuh)  told  him  to  make  his  way  across  the  trench  to  the  enemy  camp where  he  should  find  out  what  they  were  doing.  With  much  difficulty Hudhayfah  crossed  the  trench  and  made  his  way  to  a  circle  of  Quraysh warriors  talking  in  the  darkness.  He  sat  near  them,  but  as  there  was  no fire,  no  one  noticed  him.  He  then  heard  Abu  Sufyan's  voice:  'Let  us  go home!' he said. 'We have had enough. The horses and camels are dying, the tents keep blowing away, most of the equipment has been lost, and we can not cook our food. There is no reason to stay!' Shortly  after  hearing  this  Hudhayfah  made  his  way  quickly  and quietly back across the trench and the next morning the Muslims rejoiced to find that what he had overheard had come true-Quraysh and their allies had  gone  away!  The  siege  of  Medinah  had  ended  in  a  great  victory  for Islam. But this was not to be the end of the difficulties, for the Archangel Gabriel  the Prophet  (pbuh)  and  told  him  that he  should  punish  the Bani Qurayzah for betraying him and the Muslims. On  hearing  this,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  ordered  the  Muslims  to  march against  the  Bani  Qurayzah  as  they  hid  in  their  fortress.  The  Muslims besieged  them  for  twenty-five  days  until  they  finally  gave  in.  On surrendering,  they  asked  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  to  let  someone  judge  their case, and he agreed. He also allowed them to choose who would give the ruling. The man chosen to judge the Bani Qurayzah was Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, leader of the Aws, a tribe which had always protected the Qurayzah in the past.  Sa'd  ibn  Mu'adh  who  had  himself  been  wounded  in  the  battle, decided that the Jews should be tried by their own Holy Law, according to which anyone who broke a treaty would be put to death. As a result all the men of the Bani Qurayzah were executed and the women and children made captive. If the Jews had succeeded in their pact, Islam would have been destroyed. Instead from that day on, Medinah became a city where only Muslims lived. Very soon after peace had been restored to Medinah, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh died  of  his  wounds.  It  was  said  that  the  Archangel  Gabriel  came  in  the middle of that night and said to the Prophet (pbuh) '0 Muhammad, who is this  dead  man?  When  he  arrived,  the  doors  of  heaven  opened  and  the Throne of  Allah  shook.' The Prophet  (pbuh) got  up  as  soon  as  he  heard this, but found that Sa'd was already dead. Although he had been a heavy man, the men who carried his body to the grave found it quite light. They   were  told  that  the  angels  were  helping  them.  When  he  was  buried,  the Prophet (pbuh) said three times 'Subhan Allah!' (Glory be to Allah!), and 'Allahu Akbar!' (Allah is Most Great!). When asked why he did this, he replied,  'The  grave  was  tight  for  this  good  man,  until  Allah  eased  it  for him.'  This  is  one  of  the  rewards  that  Allah  gives  to  martyrs  and  good Muslims."

                "The Treaty Of Hudaybiyah": "Ouraysh  had  tried  to  destroy  Islam  but  had  failed.  The  number  of Muslims grew and their armies increased from three hundred at the battle of  Badr,  seven  hundred  at  the  battle  of  \"Uhud,  to  three  thousand  at  the battle of the Trench. After the annual fast of Ramadan, the Prophet (pbuh) had  a  dream,  which  indicated  that  the  Muslims  should  go  to  Mecca  for the pilgrimage. One thousand and four hundred Muslims got ready to go with  him  on  the  Lesser  Pilgrimage  called  'the  `Umra'.  They  dressed  in white and went unarmed to show Quraysh that they had come to make the pilgrimage and not to fight. When Quraysh heard that the Prophet (pbuh) was  on  his  way,  they  sent  troops  with  Khalid  Ibn  al-Walid  to  stop  the Muslims  from  entering  the  city.  To  avoid  meeting  this  small  army  the Prophet  (pbuh)  changed  his  route  and  led  the  men  through  rugged mountain passes. When they reached easier ground he told them, 'Say, we ask  Allah's  forgiveness  and  we  repent  towards  Him  'At  Hudaybiyah, south  of  Mecca,  the  Prophet's  camel  knelt  down  and  refused  to  go  any further.  The  Muslims  thought  she  was  either  stubborn  or  tired,  but  the Prophet  (pbuh)  said:  'The  same  power  that  once  stopped  the  elephant from entering Mecca is now stopping us!' He then ordered them to make camp, which they did, although they all hoped they would travel on to the sacred Ka'bah the following day. On  setting  up  camp,  the  believers  were  dismayed  to  find  that  the springs  were  almost  dry.  When  he  heard  this  the  Messenger  of  Allah (pbuh) instructed a man called Najiyah to take the bowl of water in which he had performed his ablutions, pour it into the hollows where the small amount of spring water lay, and stir it with his arrows. Najiyah did as he was  told  and  the  fresh  water  gushed  up  so  suddenly  that  he  was  hardly able to get out of the way in time. Messengers  were  sent  to  Quraysh  to  tell  them  that  the  Muslims  had come only for the pilgrimage, to worship Allah at the Holy Ka'bah, and that they wanted to enter the city peacefully. But Quraysh took no notice. Finally,  the  Prophet's  son-in-law,  'Uthman  Ibn  Affan,  a  wise  and respected man, was chosen to go, and the Muslims settled down to wait and  see  what  news  he  would  bring  back.  After  they  had  waited  a  long time, the Muslims became very worried. At last they decided that he must have been killed. A state similar to that of Revelation then came upon the Prophet (pbuh). He gathered the Muslims around him under an acacia tree and  asked  them  to  swear  their  allegiance  to  him,  which  they  did.  This pact, which  is  mentioned  in  the  Qur'an,  became known  as  the Treaty  of Radwan  (which  means  Paradise).  Shortly  after,  `Uthman  Ibn  Affan     returned and the Muslims were relieved to see that no harm had come to him.  Some  Meccan  warriors  tried  to  attack  the  Muslim  camp  but  were captured and brought before the Prophet (pbuh), who forgave them when they  promise  to  stop  attacking  the  Muslims.  Soon  after  this,  official messengers came from Quraysh and talks began for a peaceful settlement. A  man  called  Suhayl  ibn  'Amr  was  sent  by  the  Meccans  to  work  out  a treaty. When the Prophet (pbuh) asked 'Ali to write 'In the Name of Allah, the  Most  Gracious,  the  Most  Merciful',  on  the  top  of  the  page,  Suhayl objected, saying 'Write only: bismik Allahumma (in Thy name, 0 Allah). I don't know him as al-Rahman (the Most Gracious), al-Rahim (the most Merciful).'  The  Prophet  (pbuh)  agreed  and  dictated:  'This  is  a  treaty between Muhammad the Messenger of Allah and Suhayl ibn 'Amr.''Stop!' cried  Suhayl,  'I  don't  believe  that  you  are  Rasulallah  (the  Messenger  of Allah).  If  I  thought  you  were  Allah's  Messenger,  I  wouldn't  be  fighting against you, would I?' Calmly, the Prophet (pbuh) agreed that he should be  referred  to  in  the  treaty  as  Muhammad',  son  of  'Abd  Allah.  The Muslims were very upset at this, and 'Umar furiously cried out, 'Are you not Allah's Messenger, and are we not Muslims? How can we accept such treatment when we are right and they are wrong? This will make people laugh at our religion!' But the Prophet (pbuh) knew what was best and the Treaty of Hudaybiyah was signed. In this treaty the two sides agreed to stop fighting for a period often years.  It  was  also  agreed  that  the  Muslims  should  go  back  to  Medinah immediately  but  that  they  could  return  the  following  year  for  the pilgrimage. This pilgrimage would last three days. In addition, the treaty allowed Muslims wishing to leave Islam and return to Mecca to do so. It  also  permitted  Meccans  to  leave  and  become  Muslims  provided they had the permission of their guardians. The Muslims agreed to send any Meccan who did not have their guardian's permission back to Mecca. Suhayl's  son  had  come  with  his  father  with  the  idea  of  joining  the Prophet (pbuh) but when the treaty was signed he was, of course, forced to  return  to  Mecca.  He  cried  bitterly.  The  Prophet  (pbuh)  said,  '0  Abu Jandal, be patient and control yourself. Allah will provide relief and find a way out for you and others like you.' The majority of the Muslims were very disappointed when they heard the  terms  of  the  agreement  and  thought  that  it  should  not  have  been accepted. They did not realize that this was in fact a great victory for the Prophet  (pbuh),  which  Allah  would  later  confirm  in  a  Revelation.  The agreement  made  sure  that  the  following  year  they  would  enter  Mecca peacefully,  and  in  time  would  result  in  Muslims  becoming  stronger  and   more respected throughout Arabia. At the time the treaty was signed the Muslims  could  not  have  foreseen  that  the  number  of  people who  would travel to Medinah to become Muslims in following year would be greater than in all the years before. Before the Muslims departed, they followed the  Prophet's  example  of  making  sacrifice  and  either  shaving  or  cutting their hair. Even though they were unable to visit the sacred mosque, their pilgrimage was accepted by Allah because it had been their true intention. On the return journey to Medinah, the 'Victory' chapter of the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet (pbuh). It begins: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “Surely  We  have  given  thee  (0  Muhammad)  a  clear  victory,  That Allah may forgive thee of thy sin That which is past and that which is to come,  And  may  complete His blessings upon thee,  And  may guide thee on  the  right  path,  And  that  Allah  may  help  thee  with  mighty  help”. (Qur'an 48.1-3) Now most of those who left Mecca to join the Prophet (pbuh) without the  consent  of  their  guardians  and  were  turned  back  by  him  as  agreed, Did  not  in  fact  return  to  Mecca,  but  lived  instead  in  groups  along  the seashore. Then they were joined by others who had left Mecca but these groups began to endanger Quraysh caravans which were passing by and disrupted their trade because of this, Quraysh told the Prophet (pbuh) that if he wanted to take these new Muslims, they would not ask for them to be returned. The young men, therefore, joined the Prophet (pbuh) and the people in Mecca and Medinah grew more at ease with one another. The young  men  from  the  seashore  were  shortly  followed  by  those  Muslims who were still living in Abyssinia, and soon the numbers of believers in Medinah had doubled. About  this  time,  Khalid  Ibn  al-Walid,  the  great  warrior  who  had defeated  the  Muslims  at  Uhud,  set  out  from  Mecca  for  Medinah.  Along the way he met 'Amr Ibn al-'As, the clever speaker who had pursued the Muslims  when  they  fled  to  Abyssinia.  'Amr,  who  had  attempted  to  find asylum  in  Abyssinia,  had  just  returned  from  that  country,  the  Negus having  urged  him  to  enter  Islam.  He  asked  Khalid,  'Where  are  you going?' Khalid replied, 'The way has become clear. The man is certainly a Prophet,  and  by  Allah,  I  am  going  to  become  a  Muslim.  How  much longer should I delay?' 'Amr Ibn al-As answered, 'I am travelling for the same  reason.  So  they  both  traveled  on  to  Medinah  to  join  the Prophet(pbuh).  The  two  men  were,  however,  worried  about  meeting  the Prophet (pbuh) because of having fought against the Muslims in the past.   Therefore,  'Amr  came  before  Allah's  Messenger  he  said,  'O  Prophet, will  my  past  faults  be  forgiven  and  no  mention  made  of  what  has  gone before?' The Prophet (pbuh) replied, 'Amr, Islam wipes away everything that happened before, as does the hijrah.' A  year  after  the  signing  of  the  Treaty  of  Hudaybiyah,  the  Prophet (pbuh)  was  able  to  lead  two  thousand  pilgrims  on  the  'Umra.  Quraysh vacated  Mecca  and  watched  the  rites  from  the  hills  above  the  city.  The agreed  period  of  three  days  was  observed,  after  which  the  Muslims returned to Medinah."

                "The Invitation": "The  peace  which  the  Treaty  of  Hudaybiyah  guaranteed  for  ten  years meant people could travel from all over Arabia to visit the Prophet (pbuh) and a great many came to declare their Islam. Also, during this period the Prophet  (pbuh)  decided  that  the  time  had  come  for  his  message  to  be taken  to  other  countries,  so  he  sent  trusted  companions  with  letters, telling of his message, to the leaders of the most powerful nations of the day. It is recorded that he said, Allah has sent me as a mercy to all men, so  take  the  message  from  me  that  Allah  has  mercy  on  you.‟  It  is  also recorded  that  some  time  before,  when  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  was  digging before the Battle of the Trench, three flashes of lightning had blared forth from a rock he had been striving to remove. These flashes had shown him the fortresses of the civilizations to the South, East, and West which were soon to come into Islam. Now at the time the Prophet (pbuh) sent out his message. Abu Sufyan and some other members of Quraysh were trading in Syria, a province of the Eastern Roman Empire (later to be called Byzantium). Also, at about this  time the Emperor  Heraclius, ruler of  this Empire,  had  a dream,  and sadly told visitors to his court in Syria: „I saw our Empire fall and victory go  to  a  people  who  do  not  follow  our  religion.'  At  first  he  thought  this must  refer  to  the  Jews  and  he  even  had  it  in  mind  to  kill  all  the  Jews living under his rule fit then an envoy from the governor of Basra arrived with  a  message  for  the  Emperor:  0  Emperor  Heraclius.  there  are  some Arabs  in  the  city  who  are  speaking  of  wonderful  happenings  in  their country', and he then told of what he had heard about the Prophet (pbuh). On  hearing  this  Heraclius  commanded  his  soldiers:  Go  and  find  me someone who can tell me more about this.' The soldiers, however, did not find  those  who  had  been  talking  about  the  Prophet  (pbuh),  but  instead found Abu Sufyan and some of his companions and brought them before the Emperor. Heraclius asked, 'Is there anyone among you who is a close relative of the  Prophet  Muhammad  (pbuh)?'  Abu  Sufyan  replied,  „I  am.‟  So  the Emperor addressed all the questions to him, thinking he would know the Prophet  (pbuh)  best.  He  said,  'Tell  me  what  is  the  Prophet's  position  in your  tribe\"  Abu  Sufyan  said,  'he  is  a  member  of  our  most  respected family.  Did  anyone  before  him  say  the  kinds  of  things  he  says?'  the Emperor went on. „No.‟ was the reply.' And was he ever accused of lying or cheating?' „Never.‟ And then the Emperor asked: „And what about his ideas and opinions, and his powers of reasoning?‟ „No one has ever had     cause to doubt him or find fault with his reasoning‟, replied Abu Sufyan. „Who  follows  him,  the  proud  or  the  humble?‟  „The  humble.‟  „Do  his followers increase or decrease?‟ „They increase‟, said Abu Sufyan, „none of his followers leave him.‟ The Emperor then turned to other matters and asked: „If he makes a treaty, does he keep it?‟ „Yes‟, Abu Sufyan replied. „Did  you  ever  fight  against  him?‟  inquired  the  Emperor.  To  which  Abu Sufyan  answered:  „Yes.  Sometimes  we  won,  sometimes  he  won,  but  he never broke his word in any agreement.‟ The emperor then asked: „What does  he  say  people  must  do?‟  „To  worship  one  God‟,  said  Abu  Sufyan. „He forbids people to worship as their fathers worshipped, and says they must  pray  to  Allah  alone,  give  elms,  keep  their  word,  and  fulfil  their duties and responsibilities.‟ Abu Sufyan had spoken the truth even though he  was  an  enemy  of  the  prophet  (pbuh),  and  did  not  become  a  Muslim until the very end of his life. But he was afraid to lie before the members of  his  caravan  who  were  also  there  with  him.  The  meeting  ended  with these  words  from  the  Emperor:  „I  see  from  this  that  he  is  indeed  a prophet. You said that his followers don not leave him which proves they have true faith, for faith does not enter the heart and then go away. I knew he was coming and if what you say is true, he will surely conquer me. If I were with him now, I would wash his feet. You may leave now.‟ It  was  not  long  after  this  that  the  messenger,  Dihyah,  arrived  at  the Syrian court bearing the Prophet Mohammed‟s letter which said, „If you accept Islam you will be safe and Allah will give you a double reward. If you do not, you will have to live with results of your decision.‟ Heraclius grabbed  the  letter.  He was  so  upset  he  could  hardly  control himself.  He said to Dihyah, „I know your master is a true prophet of Allah. Our books tell of his coming. If I were not afraid that the Romans would kill me, I would join Islam. You  must  visit  Bishop  Daghatir  and  tell  him  every  thing.  His  word  is more  respected  among  the  people  than  mine.‟  So  Dihyah  related  the message  to  the  Bishop  and  when  he  heard  it,  Daghatir  said,  „Yes,  your master  whom  we  call  Ahmed  is  mentioned  in  our  scriptures.‟  He  then changed from his black ropes into white ones and went and spoke to the people gathered in the church. ‟O Romans, a letter has come to us from Ahmed,  in  which  he  calls  us  to  Allah.  I  bear  witness  that  there  is  no Divinity but Allah and that Ahmed is his slave and messenger.‟ (Ahmed is another name for the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).) But on hearing this the  crowd  grew  angry  and  attacked  Daghatir,  beating  him  until  he  was dead.    Heraclius  was  afraid  that  the  same  thing  would  happen  to  him,  so  he spoke  to  his  generals  from  a  balcony  saying,  „O  Romans!  A  man  has written to me calling me to his religion I believe he is truly the prophet we have been told to expect. Let us follow him so that we can be happy in this world and the next.‟ The Romans cried out in anger when they heard this,  so  Heraclius  quickly  said,  „I  was  only  pretending;  I  wanted  to  see how strong your faith was. I am pleased to see that you are true to your religion.‟  Heraclius  then  suggested  that  they  attack  or  give  land  to  the Muslims  in  order  to  maintain  peace,  but  the  Romans  refused.  Realizing that he could do no more, and knowing that one day Islam would conquer Syria,  Heraclius  left  the  province  and  returned  to  Constantinople,  the capital of Eastern Roman Empire. As he rode away he turned around to look back and said, „Goodbye for the  last  time,  O  land  of  Syria!‟  Meanwhile,  another  of  the  Prophet‟s messengers  arrived  at  the  palace  of  Chosroes,  the  Shah  (or  king)  of Persia,  where  he  was  told  by  the  royal  guard:  „When  you  see  the  Shah, you must bow and not lift your head until he speaks to you.‟ To this the Prophet‟s messenger replied, `I will never do that. I bow only to Allah.‟ „Then the Shah will not accept the letter you bring‟, they said. And when the  time  came  for  the  messenger  to  see  him,  the  Shah  was  indeed  very surprised  to  see  the  man  holding  his  head  high  and  refusing  to  kneel respectfully  before  him  like  everyone  else.  Nonetheless,  the  Shah  still read out the letter: In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful “From Muhammad, Messenger of Allah to Chosroes, Shah of Persia. Peace be upon those who follow the truth, who believe in Allah and His Prophet  and  who  testify  that  there  is  no  divinity  but  Allah  and  that Muhammad is His Messenger. I ask you in the Name of Allah, because I am  His  Messenger,  to  warn  your  people  that  if  they  do  not  accept  His Message, they must live with the consequences. Become Muslim and you will  be  safe.  If  you  refuse  to  tell  them  you  will  be  to  blame  for  the ignorance of your subjects”. The Shah was furious when he read this and tore the letter into little pieces.  When  the  messenger  returned  to  Arabia  and  told  the  Prophet (pbuh) what Chosroes had done, the Prophet (pbuh) said, 'May Allah also tear  his  kingdom  into  little  pieces.'  And  several  years  later  it  happened just as the Prophet (pbuh) had said it would. As with Syria and Persia, a messenger  was  also  sent  to  the  Negus  (or  King)  of  Abyssinia,  with  the following letter:    “Peace.  Praise  be  to  Allah,  the  King,  the  All-Holy,  the  Peacemaker, the  Keeper  of  Faith,  the  Watcher.  “He  is  Allah,  there  is  no  divinity  but He, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, the All-peaceable, the Keeper of Faith,  the  Guardian,  the  Majestic,  the  Compeller,  the  All-sublime. Glorified be Allah from all that they associate with Him”.(Qur'an 59.23) And  I  testify  that  Jesus,  son  of  Mary,  is  the  spirit  of  Allah  and  His Word which He cast to Mary the Virgin, the good, the pure, so that she conceived Jesus. Allah created him from His Spirit and His Breath as He created  Adam  by  His  Hand  and  His  Breath.  I  call  you  to  Allah,  the Unique,  without  partner,  to  His  obedience,  and  to  follow  me  and  to believe in that which came to me, for I am the Messenger of Allah. Peace be upon all those who follow true guidance. The King of Abyssinia was a very wise man, and was thought by the world  to  be  a  good  Christian.  He  had,  of  course,  already  heard  of  the Prophet (pbuh) and his religion from the Muslims who had sought refuge in his country years before. He was deeply moved by the letter and when he came down from his throne it was not just to show his respect but also to declare that he was already a Muslim. He answered the Prophet's letter with  one  of  his  own.  “To  Muhammad  the  Prophet  of  Allah  from  the Negus  al-Asham,  King  of  Abyssinia.  Assalamu  aleikum  0  Prophet  of Allah wa rahmatullah wa Barakatuhu. There is none like Him who has guided me to Islam. I received your letter,  O  Messenger  of  Allah.  Some  of  your  followers,  as  well  as  your cousin Ja'far, still live here. I believe you arc truly the Messenger of God and reaffirm the pledge of allegiance I made to you some time ago before your  cousin  Ja‟far,  at  whose  hand  I  joined  Islam  and  surrendered  to  the Lord of the Worlds. A  fourth  messenger  had,  in  the  meantime,  traveled  by  boat  to Alexandria to meet the Muqawqis, the ruler of Egypt, who was a Coptic Christian. In his letter, the Prophet (pbuh) invited the Muqawqis to accept Islam,  because  Christian  who  believed  in  the  message  of  Jesus  should also believe in him, for he had come with the same message from Allah. It read:          In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful, “From Muhammad, son of 'Abd Allah to the great Copt. Peace he upon whoever follows the Truth. I beseech you to accept Islam. Become a Muslim. Allah will reward you twice. If  you  refuse,  you  will  carry  the  blame  for  not  allowing  your  people  to share in this blessing”. The Muqawqis showed respect for what the letter said. He treated the messenger well, and sent many presents with him for the  Prophet  (pbuh),  but  he  did  not  become  a  Muslim.  Although  only Abyssinia responded to the Prophet's call to Islam, all was not lost, for a few  years  later  Persia,  Syria  and  Egypt  all  became  Muslim  countries."

                "Entry Into Mecca": "Despite  the  improved  relations  between  Mecca  and  Medinah  after  the signing of the Treaty of Hudaybiyah, the ten-year peace was to be broken by Quraysh who, with their allies, the Bani Bakr, attacked the Khuza‟ah tribe.  Now  Khuza‟ah  were  allies  of  the  Muslims  and  when  the  Prophet (pbuh)heard of the attack he immediately ordered his men to prepare for war. When they were ready he told them that their destination was Mecca and, as he did not want any fighting within the walls of the city, he told them they must move quickly and take the enemy by surprise. In this way the  Meccans  would  not  have  time  to  prepare  for  war  and,  being surrounded would have to surrender. The Muslims would then be able to take the city without injury or loss of life to anyone. When  the  Muslim  army,  which  numbered  ten  thousand,  set  out  for Mecca  it  was  the  month  of  Ramadan  in  the  eighth  year  of  the  Hijrah. Many  of  the  men  kept  the  fast,  even  though  they  were  not  obliged  to because  they  were  travelling.  Everyone  was  jubilant  because  they  were going to Mecca, especially as some of them had not seen their homes in the  city  for  eight  long  years.  In  the  meantime,  the  Prophet's  uncle,  al- 'Abbas, had decided that the time had come for him and his wife to leave Mecca  and  join  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  in  Medinah.  They  did  not, however, have  to  go  far  as  after  a  distance  of  only  twenty-five  kilometers  they came  across  the  Muslim  camp.  When  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  saw  them  he said,  'Uncle,  your  emigration  is  the  last  emigration.  My  prophecy  is  the last  prophecy.'  Al-'Abbas  then  joined  the  army  and  his  wife  went  on  to the safety of Medinah. Night  fell  and  the  Muslims  made  fires  to  light  their  camp.  The Meccans, looking out of the city, were amazed to see the many fires, and Abu  Sufyan  went  all  over  Mecca  trying to  find  out  whose  camp  it  was. Suddenly he saw al-„Abbas riding towards him from the direction of the fires. He was returning as a messenger of peace from the Prophet (pbuh) and said to Abu Sufyan, 'The Muslims have come with a large army. They do not wish to fight, only to enter the city. It would be better to surrender and not fight. Come under my protection and meet the Prophet (pbuh).' Abu Sufyan agreed, and got up behind al-Abbas, who was riding the  Prophet‟s  white  mule.  It  was  still  night  as  they  entered  the  Muslim camp. Each time they passed a fire, someone would call out, 'Who goes there?' None of them recognized the stranger as the leader of their enemy but all knew al-„Abbas and so let them through. As they passed by 'Umar, however,  he  immediately  recognized  Abu  Sufyan  and  yelled  out,  'Abu Sufyan!  The  enemy  of  Allah!'  He  ran  after  them  intending  to  kill  his     enemy but al-„Abbas made the mule go faster. They reached the Prophet's tent  just  before  „Umar  who  rushed  in  after  them  quite  out  of  breath. 'Umar begged the Prophet (pbuh), '0 Messenger of Allah, let me end the life of Abu Sufyan, this enemy of Islam, who has led the Quraysh armies in  their  attacks  on  us!'  Al-„Abbas  interrupted,  saying,  'I  have  sworn  to protect  him  during  his  time  here  whereupon  the Prophet  (pbuh)  told  his uncle to take Abu Sufyan to his tent for the night. In the morning Abu Sufyan was taken to the Prophet (pbuh) who said, 'Abu  Sufyan!  Have  you  not  yet  realized  that  there  is  no  divinity  but Allah?' To this Abu Sufyan replied, 'If there had been another he surely would Have helped me by now.‟ „Shame on you, Abu Sufyan', responded the  Prophet  (pbuh),  'it  is  time  you  realize  that  I  am  truly  Allah's Messenger.' After a moment or two, Abu Sufyan, who remembered how „Umar  had  not  been  allowed  to  kill  him,  replied:  'I  can  see  you  are  a generous and forgiving man but I still cannot be sure of that.' At this, al- „Abbas, who had been standing nearby turned to him and said: „Believe as  I  do  now.'  Abu  Sufyan  stood  quietly  for  a  moment,  then  in  a  calm, clear voice swore in front of everyone, there is no divinity but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.' The  Prophet  (pbuh)  then  told  Abu  Sufyan  to  go  back  to  Mecca  and tell  the  people  that  the  Muslims  would  enter  the  city  the  next  morning. Before he left, however, al-'Abbas suggested to the Prophet (pbuh) that as Abu Sufyan was a proud man, it would be good to give him an honorable position. The Prophet (pbuh) took this advice, saying to Abu Sufyan, 'Tell the people that when we enter, anyone seeking refuge in your house will be safe.' This was a great honor for Abu Sufyan. In  addition,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  told  him  to  assure  the  Meccans  that those who remained in their own homes or at the Ka‟bah would also be protected. Abu Sufyan returned quickly to the city. He made straight for the hill Hagar  had  climbed  in  her  search  for  water  and  from  which  the  Prophet (pbuh) later spoke, and called upon Quraysh to come to him. Abu Sufyan then spoke to the people, '0 people of Mecca, the fires we saw all around us were the camp fires of Muhammad and his men. He has come with a strong army and there are too many for us to fight. It is best, therefore, to surrender. Anyone who stays in my house, or in his own home, or at the Ka'bah will be safe.'     Early next day, the Muslims entered Mecca from all sides. They had been ordered to cause no harm unless anyone tried to stop them entering. When the Prophet (pbuh) arrived, he got off  his camel, bowed down on the ground and thanked Allah for this victory. When the unbelievers saw this, they knew that the Prophet (pbuh) had come in peace. People began leaving their homes and running towards the Ka‟bah. When they arrived there,  they  found  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  performing  the  ritual  encircling  of the Ka'bah, the tawaf on his camel, surrounded by the Muslims. When he had  finished,  he  said,  'There  no  divinity  except  Allah  and  He  has  no partner. Men  and  women  of  Quraysh  be  not  proud for  all  are  equal;  we are all the sons of Adam, and Adam was made of dust.' Then he recited this verse to them: “O  mankind!  Lo!  We  have  created  you  male  and  female,  and  have made  you  nations  and  tribes  so you may  know  each  another.  Surely the noblest of you, in the sight of Allah, is the best in conduct. Lo! Allah is All-knowing, All-aware”. (Qur'an 49.13) After this he said to them: 'O Quraysh, what do you think I am going to  do  to  you?'  The  people  thought  carefully  before  answering  because they  knew  that  according  to  the  laws  of  war  they  could  all  be  taken prisoner. They also knew, however, that the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was generous, so they replied, „You will treat us as a kind nephew and a generous brother would.' To this he replied with the words used by the Prophet Joseph when his brothers came to Egypt: 'God forgives you and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.' Later the Prophet (pbuh) went to the hill of Safa and there the crowd followed him and surged forward, taking his hand one by one, to declare themselves Muslim. He then turned to the Ka'bah and, pointing his staff at the three hundred and sixty-five idols which were placed there, recited from the Qur'an: “… Truth has come and falsehood has vanished away. Lo! Falsehood is ever bound to vanish”. (Qur'an 17.81) At this, each idol fell over onto its face. Together with his followers the  Prophet  (pbuh)  then  proceeded  to  purify  the  Ka'bah,  after  which  he ordered Bilal to climb on top of it and perform the call to prayer. Since then the call to prayer has been heard five times a day in Mecca.     The Ka'bah, the House of Allah, has served the purpose for which it was  built  by  Abraham  thousands  of  years  ago,  as  a  sanctuary  for  the worship  of  Allah,  our  Creator,  and  Mecca  continues  to  be  the  spiritual centre of Islam. On  the  day  Mecca  was  conquered,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  addressed  the people saying:  'Allah made Mecca holy the day He created heaven and earth  and  it  is  the  Holy  of  Holies  until  the  Resurrection  Day.  It  is  not lawful for anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood therein, nor to cut down trees therein. It was not lawful for anyone before me and it will not be lawful for anyone after me. Indeed it is not lawful for me except at this time, only Allah's anger against his people makes it permissible. Mecca has now regained its former holiness. Let those here now go forth and tell others.'."

                "The Lesson Of Pride At The Valley Of Hunayn": "Islam  flourished  in  Mecca  and  the  Muslims  became  stronger  and stronger.  But  south  of  Mecca  lived  a  tribe  of  warriors  called  Hawazin, who had not become Muslim. They made an agreement with another tribe from  Ta'if,  called  Thaqif  to  fight  the  Muslims  and  destroy  them  before they could spread their religion throughout Arabia. The Thaqif, who were known  for  their  courage,  soon  won  the  support  of  other  tribes  living around the Ta'if area, especially when such tribes were told: „Look what has  happened!  If  Quraysh,  the  largest  tribe  of  all,  have  fallen  to Muhammad, it is only a matter of time before the same will happen to the rest  of  us.  We  should  strike  now  before  the  Muslims  are  established  in Mecca and have the support of Quraysh.' The Chief of one of these tribes, a  fearless  warrior  called  Malik  Ibn  „Awf,  was  chosen  as  the  leader.  He put forward a plan: 'You should all go out to battle accompanied by your families, your tents, your sheep and goats, for with all your belongings at stake, none of you will dare give up the fight.' Everyone agreed with Malik except an old, blind man called Dorayd. He had been a great warrior in his day and because of his experience and valuable advice still accompanied the men into battle. 'I don't like Malik's plan', he insisted. 'If a man is so cowardly as to leave a battle, then he will leave his family as well. The women and children will be a great worry to us and if we are defeated all our wealth will fall into enemy hands.' But Malik  ignored  this  advice  and  stuck  to  his  original  plan.  When  the Prophet  (pbuh)  heard  what  the  enemy  tribes  were  planning,  he  found himself forced to fight and ordered his army towards Ta‟if. He had twelve thousand  men  and  the  enemy  only  four  thousand.  The  Muslims  were proud of their strength and as they looked around at their number, said to themselves,  'We  will  never  be  defeated!'  On  hearing  this  the  Prophet (pbuh) knew that the Muslims had become too proud and because of this would not succeed. He warned them, 'Look to Allah and not to your own strength.‟ The  time  for  battle  came.  The  Muslim  army  advanced  along  the Hunayn path, a narrow way in the rugged mountains, towards the valley where  the  Hawazin  and  the  other  tribes  were  waiting.  It  was  very  early morning and not yet light. The Muslims were unaware that, under cover of darkness, the Hawazin warriors had already climbed up the mountain and  were  waiting  for  them.  As  soon  as  all  the  Muslims  were trapped  in the narrow  passage-way below, the  Hawazin  ambushed  them.  First  they threw rocks down upon them and then attacked with arrows and swords.     In  surprise  and  fear,  the  Muslims  started  to  retreat.  The  Prophet (pbuh)  was  bitterly  disappointed  to  see  them  fleeing  in  terror  but  he stayed firmly in his place with Abu Bakr, 'Ali, his uncle al-„Abbas, and a few  companions  at  his  side.  Al-'Abbas  then  called  to  the  Muslims  to return and not to abandon the Prophet (pbuh). Ashamed at what they had done, and seeing the Prophet (pbuh) facing the enemy almost alone, the Muslims quickly returned to fight. Then Allah sent His angels-the hosts ye cannot see-to their aid. A fierce battle followed. The Muslim warriors advanced,  attacking  furiously,  driving  the  Hawazin  back  from  the  path into the valley, where the fighting went on long and hard. At the end of the  day  the  Muslims  won  but  not  before  having  learned  a  hard  lesson about the danger of pride. Just  as  the  old  man  had  predicted,  the  defeated  enemy  fled,  leaving their families and possessions to be captured. Later all the leaders of the tribes  except  one  came  to  ask  for  them  back  and  to  declare  their acceptance of Islam. The Prophet (pbuh) forgave them and returned their families  to  them,  but  not  their  belongings.  The  one  exception  was  the leader  of  Hawazin.  He  fled  to  Ta'if,  where  he  sought  protection  in  the castle, but the Muslims pursued him and surrounded the city, which they besieged for about three weeks. They  tried  to  break  into  the  castle  but  after  losing  many  men  in  the attempt  the Prophet  (pbuh)  ordered  a  withdrawal.  The story  did  not  end there,  however,  for  shortly  afterwards  Hawazin  and  most  of  the  other tribes came to Mecca and declared themselves Muslim, including Malik Ibn Awf, who had led them in battle and whom the Prophet (pbuh) now made their leader. After the battle of the Hunayn Valley, the Prophet (pbuh) distributed what goods had been taken between the people of Quraysh and the other Bedouin tribes. The Ansar from Medinah, who had been his only support during  the  long  hard  years  before  the  conquest  of  Mecca,  received nothing.  They  felt  angry  about  this  and  went  to  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  to complain. He said to them, what is this I hear of you? Do you think badly of me? Did I not come to you when you did not know the truth and Allah guided  you;  when  you  were  poor  and  Allah  made  you  rich;  when  you were enemies and Allah softened your hearts? Are you covetous for the things of this world that I must use to gain people's trust so that I can then lead them to Islam? Surely for you Islam is enough? Are you not satisfied that  while  some  men  take  away  flocks  and  herds  you  take  Allah's Messenger back with you to Medinah?' On hearing this, all the men felt very  contrite  and  began  to  weep  then  with  great  humility  and  reverence their  spokesman  said:  'We  are  indeed  well  pleased  to  have  Allah's   Messenger  as  our  gift  in  this  life.‟  Perhaps  we  could  ask  ourselves  the same  question.  Are  we  not  blessed  to  have  the  Prophet  Muhammad (pbuh) and the Book, guiding us in what really matters for ever and ever? Is  this  not  so  much  more  important  than  thinking  about  the  momentary pleasures of the day? Shortly  after  this  the  Ansar  left  for  Medinah  accompanied  by  the Prophet  (pbuh).  He  could  have  stayed  among  his  own  people  and  lived out his days in Mecca, but he returned as he had promised, to live among the people of Medinah, which was a great blessing for them. “Allah  gave  you  victory  on  many  fields  and  on  the  day  of  Hunayn, when you exulted in your great numbers it was of no help to you, and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you; then you turned back in flight; Then  Allah  sent  His  peace  of  reassurance  down  upon  is  Messenger  and upon the believers, and sent down hosts you could not see, and punished those  who  did  not  believe.  Such  is  the  reward  of  disbelievers.  Then afterwards Allah will relent toward whom He will; for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful”. (Qur'an 9.25-27)."

                "Tabuk-The Test Of Faith": "News of the growing power of the Muslims, as more and more of Arabia followed  the  Prophet  (pbuh),  eventually  reached  Heraclius,  Emperor  of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Romans saw the uniting of the Arabs in Islam as a possible threat to their Empire and the Emperor's advisors and generals,  therefore,  decided  that  the  best  thing  to  do  would  be  to  attack the Muslims from the north and east at the same time and destroy Islam once and for all. Two years had passed since Heraclius had told them of the Prophet's letter  asking  them  to  submit  to  Islam,  but  just  as  then,  they  were  in  no mood now to listen to such ideas. When the Prophet (pbuh) heard of the Romans'  plans,  he  decided  that  it  would  be  better  to  meet  the  Roman army in Tabuk, some 500 kilometers form Medinah on the route to Syria, than to await an attack on Medinah. One reason for this decision was that the Prophet (pbuh) felt that if the Muslims were defeated at Medinah, the city  as  well  as  the  army  would  be  taken,  which  would  mean  the  end  of Islam.  This  was  a  very  hard  decision  for  him  to  make  because  not  only was  Tabuk  a  very  long  way  away,  but  it  was  also  harvest  time  and  a particularly  hot  year.  Added  to  this  was  the  fact  that  the  enemy  had  an enormous  army.  Now  at  this  time  there  were  some  people  living  in Medinah  who  were  not  true  believers.  They  were  called  'hypocrites' because they pretended to believe but hid what was truly in their hearts. When the Prophet (pbuh) everyone to war, these hypocrites tried to create fear  and  doubt  among  the  Muslims,  saying  'How  can  we  hope  to  defeat the  Romans  whose  great  empire  stretches  over  vast  areas  of  the  world? And  even  if  we  could,  we  will  not  get  the  chance  because  the  long journey and the heat will defeat us first. In any case, our crops and fruits are ready to be harvested; how can we leave them? We will be ruined if we do!' All that the hypocrites said severely tested the Muslims. Who would continue to fight for his religion against such odds? Who would have the courage to give his wealth to help equip an army? This test of faith would indeed show who the true Muslims were. On this question, Allah revealed the following verse: “O you who believe! What aileth you that when it is said unto you: Go  forth  in  the  way  of  Allah,  you  are  bowed  down  to  the  ground  with heaviness. Do you take pleasure in the life of the world rather than in the Hereafter?  The  comfort  of  the  life  of  the  world  is  but  little  in  the Hereafter”. (Qur'an 9.38)      To form and equip an army the Prophet (pbuh) needed a great deal of money  and  despite  all  that  the  hypocrites  had  said,  many  Muslims, especially the Prophet‟s close friends, were willing to help. 'Uthman Ibn „Affan,  for  instance,  generously  provided  horses  and  arms  for  ten thousand soldiers and Abu Bakr gave all that he had in the world. „Umar, too,  gave  a  great  deal,  and  in  this  way  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  was  able  to equip an army of forty thousand soldiers. Finally  everything  was  ready  but  just  as  they  were  about  to  leave, seven more men came to the Prophet (pbuh) to ask if they could go with him.  Unfortunately,  he  had  to  refuse  because  there  were  no  animals  for them  to  ride.  The  seven  men  were  so  upset  that  they  wept  as  they  left. With nothing more to be done, the army moved off, but just then several spare camels were found. On learning of this, the Prophet (pbuh) sent for the seven men, who were overjoyed to find that they could join him in his fight. By now the Romans had heard that the Muslims were coming out to meet  them.  They  felt  even  more  sure  of  victory  when  they  heard  this because  they  believed  that  it  would  be  quite  impossible  for  an  army  to cross  a  waterless  desert  in  the  scorching  summer  sun.  Even  if  by  some miracle the Muslims succeeded, they would be so exhausted that it would be easy to defeat them. As it happed the heat was so intense and the journey so difficult that several  Muslims  did  turn  back.  The  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  most  of  the others,  however,  continued  until  they  finally  ran  out  of  water.  The expedition  now  seemed  hopeless  as  the  men  grew  thirstier  and  thirstier. The  Prophet  (pbuh)  prayed  to  Allah  for  help  and,  as  he  finished  his prayer, the first drops of rain came splashing down. The rain continued to fall  until  all  the  Muslims  had  drunk  their  fill.  That  night  they  slept soundly  for  the  first  time  in  days,  refreshed  by  the  water  and  confident that Bilal would wake them as usual for the dawn prayer. But Bilal slept so deeply that he did not wake up. It was the first time that the Muslims had  missed  a  prayer  and  they  were  very  upset.  The  Prophet  (pbuh), however,  was  not  angry  with  Bilal  and  told  the  Muslims  that  they  need not be upset because they had not intentionally missed the prayer. The Prophet (pbuh) and his army continued their trek across the desert and finally arrived at the oasis of Tabuk. When they got there, however, they were surprised to find that the Roman army had retreated in fear on hearing  of  the  miraculous  crossing  of  the  desert  by  the  Muslims.  The Prophet  (pbuh)  waited  at  the  oasis  for  a  while  but  when  it  became   apparent  that  the  Romans  were  not  going  to  fight,  he  gave  the  order  to return  home.  The  enemy  was  not  pursued  because  the  Prophet  (pbuh) only  fought  when  attacked.  The  long  march  to  Tabuk  had  been  yet another  test  of  faith  for  the  Muslims.  Even  so,  there  were  still  some among  those  who  made  that  heroic  journey  who  were  hypocrites, pretending to be sincere while being enemies of Islam in their hearts. No one could have suspected that anyone who had made that journey across the desert with the Prophet (pbuh) would be an enemy of his. Realizing this, several hypocrites plotted to kill the Prophet (pbuh) by pushing  him  off  the  top  of  a  high,  rocky  passage  that  ran  between  the mountains  of  „Aqabah.  Before  the  army  reached  this  rocky  passage, however,  Allah  warned  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  about  this  wicked  plan.  The Prophet  (pbuh),  therefore,  ordered  the  entire  army  to  travel  through  the valley  while  he  and  his  two  guards  went  by  way  of  the  cliff.  As  the plotters  approached,  he  shouted  to  them  so  that  they  could  see  that  he knew  of  their  plan,  whereupon  they  quickly  ran  back  to  the  army  and tried to hide among the rest of the soldiers. Later,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  gathered  his  followers  around  him  and  told them what had happened. He picked out the men who had plotted against him  and even told them the exact  words they had spoken to each other. Some of the Prophet's companions said that these men should be killed, but  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  forgave  them.  As  soon  as  he  arrived  back  in Medinah, the Prophet (pbuh) went to the mosque and prayed. Many of the hypocrites and the lukewarm who had not gone with him to Tabuk came to give their reasons for not having done so. Three men of spiritual value who had not joined the army were subjected by the Prophet (pbuh) to the discipline of waiting for Allah's forgiveness. For fifty days no one spoke to  them.  Finally,  Allah  revealed  a  verse  to  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  which declared that these three men were forgiven: “Allah hath turned in mercy to the Prophet, and to the Muhajirin and the Ansar who followed him in the hour of hardship. After the hearts of a party  of  them  had  almost  swerved  aside,  then  He  turned  unto  them  in mercy. Lo! He is full of Pity, Merciful. And to the three also (did He turn in  mercy)  who  were  left  behind,  when  the  earth,  vast  as  it  is,  was straitened for them, and their own souls were straitened for them till they understood that there is no refuge from Allah save toward Him. Then He turned  unto  them  in  mercy  that  they  (too)  might  turn  (repentant  unto Him). Lo! Allah! He is the Relenting, the Merciful. O you who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah, and be with tile truthful”. (Qur'an 9.117- )."

                "The Farewell Pilgrimage": "The Prophet (pbuh) had become the most powerful leader in the whole of Arabia. After the idols in the Ka'bah had been smashed and Quraysh had become Muslim, most of the other tribes of Arabia came to declare their Islam.  The  year  in  which  they  came  was  later  to  be  called  the  Year  of Deputations. As each tribe joined Islam, the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) sent  his  men  to  teach  them  about  their  new  religion.  Many  people  also came to Medinah to question the Prophet (pbuh) himself. One tribe sent a man  called  Dimam,  who  was  large  and  strong.  On  arriving  in  Medinah, he went straight to the mosque, where the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was sitting with some of his companions, and stood over the Prophet (pbuh). In  a  loud,  rough  voice  he  asked,  'Which  of  you  is  the  son  of  'Abd  al- Muttalib?' When the Prophet (pbuh) answered him Dimam went on, 'I am going to ask you a hard question, so do not misunderstand me. I ask you to  swear  by  Allah,  your  Allah,  the  Allah  of  those  before  you  and  the Allah  of  those  who  will  come  after  you,  has  He  sent  you  to  us  as  a messenger?'  'Yes,  He  has',  replied  the  Prophet  (pbuh).  'Has  Allah instructed you to order us to serve Him; to pray these five prayers; to pay alms;  to  fast;  to  make  the  pilgrimage  and  to  follow  the  other  laws  of Islam)?' continued Dimam. When the Prophet (pbuh) answered that Allah had indeed instructed him in this way, Dimam became a Muslim and, as he left, added, 'Then I will do the things we are told to do and avoid the things  we  are  forbidden-no  more  and  no  less.`  As  Dimam  mounted  his camel to leave, the Prophet(pbuh) told the people around him, 'If this man is sincere, he will go to Paradise.' When Dimam reached his people they all  thought  he  had  gone  mad  but  by  nightfall,  after  he  had  finished speaking, there was not among them that had not accepted Islam. When the time came for the yearly pilgrimage, it was proclaimed that the  prophet  (pbuh)  would  be  going  to  Mecca.  The  Muslims  flocked  to Medinah from all over Arabia to join him on his journey to the Ka‟bah. As  the  tribes  arrived  they  camped  around  the  city  until  they  finally numbered more than thirty thousand. The  Prophet  (pbuh)  went  out  with  his  family  and  friends  to pilgrimage, but before setting off, he led all the Muslims in prayer. After the  prayers,  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  got  on  his  camel  and  headed  towards Mecca  followed  by  the  pilgrims,  all  of  whom,  for  the  first  time  in centuries,  worshipped  Allah,  the  One  God.  The  Prophet  (pbuh)  and  his companions  were  deeply  moved  by  the  sight  of  the  huge  number  of Muslims accompanying them to Mecca, carrying no arms, and fearing no one. They could not help but remember their original flight from Mecca when they had been so few in number and were forced to leave in order    to  avoid  the  anger  of  Quraysh.  Throughout  the  journey  the  Muslims repeated a prayer taught to them by the Prophet (pbuh) which he in turn had  received  from  the  Archangel  Gabriel.  This  prayer,  the  talbiyah,  has been part of the Hajj ritual ever since. It is in answer to the call Abraham was  commanded  to  make  when  he  and  Ishmael  finished  building  the Ka‟bah. Labaik  Allahumma  labaik,  labaik  la  sharika  laka  labaik  in  al- hamd  wa  al-ni'amatu  laka  wal-mulk,  la  sharika  laka.  Here  I  am,  O Allah, at Thy service. Here I am, Thou art without partner, here I am. All Praise and blessings are thine, and Dominion! Thou art without partner! After ten days the pilgrims marched at sunset through the same pass by which they had entered on the Day of Conquest of Mecca. When they reached the Ka‟bah, the Prophet (pbuh) stood before it in prayer, then he and  all  the  Muslims  walked  around  it  seven  times  saying  their  prayer aloud. Next, just as Abraham had done, they went towards the Mount of Mercy at 'Arafah, which the Prophet (pbuh) ascended on a camel. From the mountain he led the people in prayer and then spoke to them as they stood assembled on the vast plain below. What  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  said  is  known  as  the  „Farewell  Sermon‟, because it was the last speech the Prophet (pbuh) made before he died. He said, 'surely you will meet your Lord and He will question you about your works.' He asked the Muslims to take their guidance from the Qur'an and from his own example. This, he said, was the best way to live. He ordered them to cease living in the way they had before Islam. Revenge,  one  of  the  oldest  traditions  in  Arabia,  was  ended  forever; usury  was  prohibited;  property  was  to  be  respected.  Things  which previously were forbidden during the four sacred months of the year were now  forbidden  at  all  times.  He  then  commanded,  'Know  that  every Muslim  is  a Muslim's  brother',  which  was  a completely  new  idea  to  the tribes  who  had  so  often  quarreled  in  the  past.  He  also  said,  'Allah  has given everyone his due-exactly what each one deserves. After each point the Prophet (pbuh) asked, 'Have I explained it well? Is it perfectly clear?' Everyone answered, 'Yes.' For these were the people who would have to pass on the Prophet's message and instructions to those who were unable to be present that day and to future generations. The Prophet (pbuh) said, 'I  have  left  you  two  things.  If  you  hold  on  to  them  you  will  be  saved. They  are  Allah's  Book  and  the  words  of  your  Prophet.'  He  then  asked, 'Have I not conveyed the message?' The multitude shouted out, 'By Allah, yes!' The Prophet (pbuh) ended, '0 Allah! Bear witness to that.'   “…  This  day  those  who  disbelieve  are  in  despair  of  (ever  harming) your religion; so do not fear them, but fear Me! This day I have perfected your religion, for you, and I have completed My favor unto you, and have chosen  for  you  as  a  religion  AL-ISLAM”.  (Qur'an  5.3)  Many  Muslims started  to  shed  tears,  knowing  that  if  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  had  completed his message, his life must be near its end. After  spending  the  rest  of  the  day  of  „Arafah  in  prayer  and contemplation,  the  Muslims  began  to  complete  the  pilgrimage  by returning  to  Mecca  with  the  talbiyah  prayer  still  on  their  lips.  The  first night of the return journey was spent at Muzdalifah. Here they gathered pebbles, which they carried with them the next day to Mina. There they stood  before  a  huge  rock  and  stoned  it  in  remembrance  of  Abraham's meeting  with  the  Devil  in  that  very  place.  When  Abraham  received  the order  from  Allah  to  sacrifice  his  son  Ishmael  as  a  test  of  his  faith,  the Devil  had  tried  to  convince  him  not  to  do  it.  He  came  to  Abraham  at Mina, as he was on his way to carry out Allah's command, but Abraham took  some  stones  and  hurled  them  at the  Devil  to  drive him  away  since the casting of stones at Mina on the Prophet's 'Farewell Pilgrimage', this has  become  another  ritual  which  Muslims  perform  on  the  annual pilgrimage to remind them that they, too, must continue to drive the Devil away when he tries to prevent them from being obedient to Allah. After throwing  the  stones,  the  pilgrims  sacrificed  sheep  and  camels  and  gave the  meat  to  the  poor.  In  this  way  the  great  faith  of  Abraham  was remembered, for when he had been ready to sacrifice Ishmael, Allah had sent a sheep in his place. The Muslims then completed the pilgrimage by again circling the Ka‟bah seven times. They then cut their hair and nails and changed out of their white clothes to show they had returned to their daily lives. Before returning to Medinah, the Muslims spent three nights in the valley at Medinah where the final preparations were made for the journey home. As  for  the  Prophet  (pbuh),  he  made  one  final  visit  before  leaving Mecca.  This  was  to  the  grave  of  his  devoted  wife,  Khadijah,  who  had been  the  first  person  to  believe  in  Allah's  Revelation  through  him.  The Prophet  (pbuh)  knew  that  this  would  be  the  last  time  he  would  see  the grave,  or  Mecca,  because  during  the  pilgrimage  he  had  received  the chapter  of  the  Qur'an  called  'Help',  form  which  he  knew  that  his  death was not far away.       In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “When  Allah's  help  and  triumph  comes  And  thou  seest,  mankind entering  the  religion  of  Allah  in  troops,  Then  hymn  the  praises  of  thy Lord, and seek forgiveness of Him. Lo! He is ever ready to show mercy”. (Qur'an 110.1-3)."

                "The Prophet’s Death": "One Night, shortly after his return to Medinah, the Prophet(pbuh) woke up at midnight and asked his servant‟ Abd Allah to saddle his mule. They then left the house and went to the Baqi al-Gharqad, the burial ground of the  Muslims.  There  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  stood  in  the  front  of  the  graves and, as though he could see the Muslims buried in them, spoke to them and  prayed  over  them.  Later,  ‟Abd  Allah  reported,  ‟The  Prophet  (pbuh) told me that he was ordered to pray for the dead and that I was to go with him.‟ After the Prophet (pbuh) had prayed he turned to „Abd Allah and said, „I  can  choose  between  all  the  riches  of  this  world,  a  long  life  and  then Paradise,  or  meeting  my  Lord  and  entering  Paradise  now.‟  „Abd  Allah begged  him  to  choose  a  long,  rich  life,  followed  by  Paradise,  but  the Prophet (pbuh) told him that he had already chosen to meet his Lord now rather  than  remain  in  the  world.  The  following  morning  the  Prophet (pbuh)  awoke  with  a  terrible  headache,  but  despite  this  he  had  led  the prayers  at  the  mosque.  From  what  he  said  afterwards  to  the  people assembled  there,  they  understood  that  his  death  was  near.  The  Prophet (pbuh)  praised  his  best  friend,  Abu  Bakr,  who  had  begun  to  weep,  and told  everyone  that  he  knew  they  would  all  meet  again  at  a  pool  in Paradise.  He  added,  however  that  although  he  was  sure  they  would always  worship  Allah  alone,  he  feared  that  the  pleasures  of  the  world would  attract  them,  and  they  would  begin  to  compete  with  one  another for  material  possessions,  forgetting  spiritual  things.  Soon  after  the Prophet (pbuh) requested that he be moved to the room of A‟isha, one of his wives. As the days passed his fever grew worse, until one day he was so ill that he could not even get to the mosque, which was next to where A‟isha  lived.  The  Prophet  (pbuh)  told  A‟isha  to  tell  the  Muslims  to  let Abu Bakr, her father, lead the prayer, which made them very sad for this was the first time anyone had taken the Prophet's place. th Later, on the 12th day of Rabi al-Awal, in the 11th year of Islam (June A.D.), the Prophet (pbuh) heard the voices of the people in prayer. With great effort he got up and looked from his door at all the Muslims who  were  assembled  in  rows  behind  Abu  bakr;  he  smiled  with  great satisfaction.  Abu  Bakr  saw  him  and  stepped  back  to  give  the  Prophet (pbuh) his place. The Muslims were happy, thinking he was going to pray with  them  as  before,  but  the  Prophet  Muhammad  (pbuh),  who  looked radiantly beautiful that day signaled to them to continue on their own. He prayed in a sitting position at the right of Abu Bakr, after which he went back inside and lay  his head on 'A'ishah's lap. He was in such pain that his  daughter  Fatimah  cried  out  in  pity.  Then  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  said,    'There is no pain for your father after this day; truly, death has appeared to me. We must all suffer it till the Day of Judgement.' As he lay there, A'ishah remembered that he had once said, Allah never takes a Prophet to Himself  without  giving  him  the  choice.'  Then  she  heard  the  Prophet (pbuh) speak. His last words were, 'Nay, rather the Exalted Communion of Paradise.' A‟ishah  then  said  to  herself,  'So,  by  Allah,  he  is  not  choosing  us!' When the people in the mosque heard that the Prophet (pbuh) was dead, they  were  filled  with  grief.  „Umar  could  not,  and  would  not,  believe  it, and  exclaimed  that  it  was  not  true.  Abu  Bakr  then  went  out  and  spoke gently  to  the  people,  saying  'All  praise  belongs  to  Allah!  0  people, whoever worshipped Muhammad, Muhammad is dead. But for him who worships Allah, Allah is living and never dies.' He then recited this verse from the Qur'an which had been revealed after the battle of Uhud: In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful “Muhammad is but a messenger, messengers (the like of whom) have passed away before him. Will it be that, when he dies or is slain, you will turn  back on  your  heels?  He  who  turns back  does  no  hurt  to  Allah,  and Allah  will  reward  the  thankful.  No  soul  can  ever  die  except  by  Allah's permission and at a term appointed. Who so desires the reward of the world, We bestow on him thereof; and  whosoever  desires  the  reward  of  the  Hereafter,  We  bestow  on  him thereof We shall reward the thankful”. (Qur'an 3.144-145) After  this  the  people  pledged  their  loyalty  to  Abu  Bakr,  whom  the Prophet  (pbuh)  had  chosen  to  lead  the  prayer.  Abu  Bakr  accepted  and concluded what he had to say with these words:  'Obey me so long as I obey  Allah  and  His  Messenger.  But  if  I  disobey  Allah  and  His Messenger, you owe me no obedience. Arise for your prayer, Allah have mercy  upon  you!'  The  people  rose  and  asked  him;  'Where  will  the Prophet (pbuh) be buried?' Abu Bakr remembered that the Prophet (pbuh) had said, 'No Prophet dies who is not buried on the spot where he died.' And  so  the  Prophet  (pbuh)  was  buried  in  a  grave  dug  in  the  floor  of A'ishah's room, in the house next to the mosque. The spot became known as the Haram al-Nabawi and Muslims from all over the world go there to pray  and  to  give  their  blessings  and  greetings  of  peace  the  Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). And Lo! thine verily will be a reward unfailing. And Lo! thou art of a tremendous nature. (Qur'an 67. 3-4)."
